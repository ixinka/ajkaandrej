      <title>Rockefeller Centre</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My two friends were in New York at the end of September and it remained me that I have two more
panorama pictures from the &amp;ldquo;big apple&amp;rdquo;. I took them at the top of the Rockefeller Centre. Although
I need to say that I prefer the beautiful views from the top of hills not from buildings, these
place was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;panorama&#34;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&#34;nofancybox panorama_img&#34; src=&#34;http://www.ajka-andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/rockefeller1.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There were many people as everywhere, but we could move freely and took pictures of whatever we
wanted. Specially, it makes me very happy that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any plexiglass at the top as it was in
Empire State building. I understand safety reasons of all these things, but I think I felt safety
enough even without all that barriers which covered the view of my camera. The most impressive view
was of course on the side with the Central Park. It was beautiful even it was brown a little bit
due to the end of the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;panorama&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about this building is also that there is only one direct lift up and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t
too big queue for it. On the way up and down you can watch very colourful video on the ceiling of
the lift and as it is kind of transparent, you can see all the way in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On the trip to USA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, after a long time of promising, we visited Mi≈°ko and Ivka in faraway America. We set off at
four in the morning, so we could catch a flight from Vienna ( I&amp;rsquo;m really thankful that I have so
great parents, that they got up so early and gave us a lift there). We flew with a very small
planeto Dusseldorf, where we had a famous pretzel, coffee and I bought a big package of
Haribogummibears. After the rest, we decided to go towards the large aircraft and the seven hour flight. My dear
husband slept all the way, I woke him up only several times when it was time to eat. I read
everything around, wrote a piece of paper and relished a large space in the aircraft, which was
amazing compared to the small planes, which I usually fly with. And then we saw the ground and
scattered houses through the window, and eventually a Statue of Liberty in the distance when we
were landing in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once at the airport I found that the beautiful accent of british English is miles away from the
american English and I only tried to listen carefully to understand them. Of course, Andrej was
very happy with that as always. Second, this time our common observation was that everything was
huge there &amp;hellip; cars, roads, buildings, and most people, so we only watched everything. Then we
waited for a taxi with Ivka. Finally we got the taxi, which made strange sounds at very beginning
and it took us only a little bit from the airport, where we changed this odd car for a nice and
more comfortable one, which took us home.A 11th floor was high enough for my first panorama and the
view was really nice as well.&lt;/p&gt;
