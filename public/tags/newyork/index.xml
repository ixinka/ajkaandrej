      <description>My two friends were in New York at the end of September and it remained me that I have two more panorama pictures from the &amp;ldquo;big apple&amp;rdquo;. I took them at the top of the Rockefeller Centre. Although I need to say that I prefer the beautiful views from the top of hills not from buildings, these place was amazing.
 There were many people as everywhere, but we could move freely and took pictures of whatever we wanted.</description>

      <description>Finally, after a long time of promising, we visited Mi≈°ko and Ivka in faraway America. We set off at four in the morning, so we could catch a flight from Vienna ( I&amp;rsquo;m really thankful that I have so great parents, that they got up so early and gave us a lift there). We flew with a very small planeto Dusseldorf, where we had a famous pretzel, coffee and I bought a big package of Haribogummibears.</description>
