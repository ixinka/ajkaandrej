      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another Oktoberfest (or Wiesn as local people would say) behind us, and this year we didn&amp;rsquo;t miss it.
Well, we didn&amp;rsquo;t join the official event in traditional clothes inside one of the huge tents, but we
dived in the great atmosphere and we drank one litter of beer. We didn&amp;rsquo;t see the initial ceremony
this year, because we weren&amp;rsquo;t in the mood to go to the town in a rainy weather, but we did spent
some hours together with our colleagues drinking beer at Oktoberfest. For me, there were too many
people there and sometimes we couldn&amp;rsquo;t walk freely just to go with the flow, but the atmosphere was
really amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
   &lt;/div&gt;



It&amp;rsquo;s unbelievable what buildings grew up on otherwise empty flat huge concrete place. Traditional
decoration, blue and white bavarian flags, merry-go-rounds, sausages, baked meat, pretzels, beer
and gingerbread and many people wearing typical leather trousers, shirts and colourful dresses with
a plunging neckline dress… well that is basically how  it looked like around us. It was said to us
that inside the tents it  is even better with traditional music, program and dancing, but it&amp;rsquo;s
better to go there dressed appropriately. You can go inside either by joining a not fully occupied
table making new friends or you can book a table for ten people a year before for about 200 euro.
Well, we will try that next time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were already several times in the &lt;a title=&#34;Lake in the Olympia park&#34;
href=&#34;http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/07/05/lake-in-the-olympia-park/&#34;&gt;Olympia park&lt;/a&gt;, but we
somehow never got to the highest hill there. To walk on its top is not really difficult, but either the weather didn&amp;rsquo;t work out for us, or we
were already tired from walking through the town so we ended up just resting near the lake below.
There is a nice paved walkway leading up to the top of the hill that is great view point as well.
We only realised when we walked there how big the whole &lt;a title=&#34;Where to go with visitors&#34;
href=&#34;http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2009/11/25/where-to-go-with-visitors/&#34;&gt;park&lt;/a&gt; is. Further lawns
and walkways revealed in front of us that are not seen from the lake otherwise. This hill, like
lots of others in Munich, was built artificially. This one grew up from a pile of rubble and ruins
left over from houses in Munich after a bombing in the Second World War. There is a beautiful view
over the park and the distant &lt;a title=&#34;Munich&#34;
href=&#34;http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2009/11/24/munich/&#34;&gt;city centre&lt;/a&gt; from the top. After all, judge
for yourself :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In the city centre</title>
      <link>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2011/05/09/in-the-city-centre</link>

      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2011/05/09/in-the-city-centre</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once again, we went to the town centre to show our weekend visitors (Andrej&amp;rsquo;s parents) how it looks
like here and where we actually live. We travelled by all sorts of trains (S-Bahn and U-Bahn and tram), we walked through  the shopping
street and stores and we looked at the ringing tower of &lt;a title=&#34;Munich&#34;
href=&#34;http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2009/11/24/munich/&#34;&gt;the new town hall&lt;/a&gt; at eleven. We overcame
the altitude difference from a minus fourth floor of the underground to around 290m high tower in
&lt;a title=&#34;Where to go with visitors&#34;
href=&#34;http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2009/11/25/where-to-go-with-visitors/&#34;&gt;Olympia Park&lt;/a&gt;. At the
central market place (Viktualienmarkt), we bought a great aromatic spices for Bruschetta (I have
already tried it and I think it would be great for pasta too, but on that later). After intensive
urban tourism, we went to our favourite Biergarten and ate typical Bavarian delicacies. Usual meals
you can get there are sausages, in addition to the classic ones also curry and typical white
sausages, fried chicken and ribs. Last time we tried a bread with lard, chives and tomatoes. This
time we had a typical cheese spread. Its title is evidently not entirely clear. In the Biergarten
you can find it under the name Opatzda or Obatzda and in the shop, it is named Obazda. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m
going to try to prepare it and then I&amp;rsquo;ll post one tested recipe here. We took also a plate with
slices of ham and chopped onions in vinaigrette, a few pretzels and a glass of beer each.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
   &lt;/div&gt;



We have already got used to that small beer is half a liter and so we enjoy watching of surprised
looks by note that there aren&amp;rsquo;t smaller cups. After watching ducks and a pleasant resting in &lt;a
title=&#34;Lake in the Olympia park&#34;
href=&#34;http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/07/05/lake-in-the-olympia-park/&#34;&gt;Olympia Park&lt;/a&gt;, we went to
see a large fair &lt;a title=&#34;Auer Dult&#34; href=&#34;http://www.auerdult.de/&#34;&gt;Auer Dult&lt;/a&gt; (Au is part of
Munich, Dult=fair). This takes place only three times a year and since I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it yet and
there was one, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the temptation to go there. It turned out that it&amp;rsquo;s partially kind
of flea market and you can get there anything, in many cases even at a bargain price.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Walking in the park</title>
      <link>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/12/07/walking-in-the-park</link>

      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/12/07/walking-in-the-park</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Walking in the park in winter, especially when there is snow everywhere, is absolutely fantastic.
Although only until the sunset, because then it starts freezing properly and it is better to hide
even in the subway. As I haven&amp;rsquo;t been in Englischer Garten at the time of snow, we went there
during the last weekend. Originally, we wanted to go sledging on the nearby hill, but the season
was just opened and so we concluded that there would be too many people anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children sledged here as well, every hill was occupied. The best shout of all was of one child
rolling down the hill shouting &amp;ldquo;yipe&amp;rdquo;, who apparently went through all the bumps. One of the
Biergarten solved the outdoor seating in the cabins of some cable car. What surprised us the most
were the surfers on the local stream. I naively believed that there are people surfing only in the
warm weather. One could say that after all they have proper wetsuits, so it actually doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter
what the weather is like. But I still think that when they throw themselves into the ice water with
uncovered faces, it must be still shock for them :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Christmas markets</title>
      <link>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/12/07/christmas-markets</link>

      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/12/07/christmas-markets</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the weekend, we went to the Christmas markets. There are quite a lot of them in Munich.
Basically, each Munich neighborhood has its own market. We went directly to the Marienplatz in the
centre. There were many stands decorated with green boughs and colorful lights. They offered many
things, among others, wooden ornaments and toys, candles and Christmas hats. I was really impressed
by one stand that offered all sorts of wooden things ( cutting boards, spatula, etc.) on which the
man in the stand drew different animals, flowers or wrote everything according to your wish. There
were also many stands (Hütte) with traditional delicacies like gingerbread (Lebkuchen), mulled wine
(Glühwein), roasted chestnuts (Maroni), grilled sausages (Bratwurst) and something that looked like
a pizza but with cream, onion and bacon and tasted incredibly good (Flammkuchen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
        &lt;a style=&#34;display:inline-block;&#34; class=&#34;fancybox&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ajka-andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_00061.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;group1&#34;&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
        &lt;a style=&#34;display:inline-block;&#34; class=&#34;fancybox&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ajka-andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_0007.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;group1&#34;&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
        &lt;a style=&#34;display:inline-block;&#34; class=&#34;fancybox&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ajka-andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_00081.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;group1&#34;&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
   &lt;/div&gt;



These markets had but two imperfections. There was almost no snow. Everything was well cleaned and
strewn with stones and somehow losing the atmosphere of winter. And then there were too many people
and tourists, so among the stands we were moved by the crowd. Therefore we decided to go to markets
in Englischer Garten or at least &lt;a title=&#34;Walking in the park&#34;
href=&#34;http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/12/07/walking-in-the-park/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;for a nice walk
in the park&lt;/a&gt;. We somehow managed to squeeze into the subway and get off. We found ourselves in
front of the snowy park surrounded by children with sledges. These markets were worth to come.
There were slightly more stands with refreshments than others. Lots of snow everywhere, Christmas
music and people with mulled wine making their hands warmer. For children there was a special tent
where they could play around while their parents ate a cabbage soup. We could see harnessing horses
ringing with bells and it all resulted in more festive mood.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oktoberfest</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anniversary of the Oktoberfest is over and people in traditional costumes are slowly but surely
disappearing from the streets and the subway, so people like us dressed only in jeans and T-shirt
don&amp;rsquo;t look like tourists anymore. &lt;div class=&#34;panorama&#34;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&#34;nofancybox panorama_img&#34; src=&#34;https://www.ajka-andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/OktoberfestSprievod.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Although we haven&amp;rsquo;t been in the beer tent on the Theresienwiese, we didn&amp;rsquo;t miss parade at the launch
of this year&amp;rsquo;s festivities. There were horse drawn carts with barrels of beer and venison, but also
agricultural machinery and many brass bands. Everyone, who was a part of this parade, moved from
the one end of the Munich centre to the area where Oktoberfest happened (about 3.5km). Well, there
were realy many people and the parade lasted three hours. We watched all the people from a balcony
at Andrej&amp;rsquo;s boss appartment with a lot of other known and unknown people and we ate typical white
sausages with sweet Bavarian mustard and cheese, salad, pretzels and of course we drank beer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

park was relatively empty and ideal for a walk :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lake in the Olympia park</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already written about the Olympia park, but that was in November last year and at that time
there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any lake but the muddy place and some people who cleaned it. Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s the
great place for visitors due to the high tower in the centre so we had a great opportunity to go
there with our friends and see the actual lake :) There were many people running around or cycling, lot of stands with ice-cream or some sweet cakes
and of course many people sitting in the bier garden. Some people rent the boats on the mentioned
lake and enjoyable summer comfort was felt everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
   &lt;/div&gt;



Another place we visited was an Olympic stadium. We somehow managed to skip it the first time, but I
suggest it is better to see it in the summer anyway. It is used only as a tourist attraction now,
which I think is shame. It&amp;rsquo;s a big nice stadium with lots of seating.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bavaria</title>
      <link>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/07/05/bavaria</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2010 13:17:59 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/07/05/bavaria</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was one of my less fortunate trip ideas, but on the other hand I don&amp;rsquo;t regret at all that I was
there. The question Where? is now on the right place &amp;hellip; in the statue called Bavaria. Recently, we
had a second visit here and after a day spent walking in the center and parks, we were thinking,
where to go next. I read that there is a statue that was created and built as a symbol of Bavaria,
it is 18 m high and it is possible to go in, upstairs and look around. Moreover, this statue look
at Oktoberfest every year, because of standing directly on the Theresienwiese, so it was a great
attraction. So why it wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy idea to go there? After the rainy week we had a wonderful hot weekend
without clouds and Bavaria is an iron statue. The bottom half is indeed a brick staircase with
shade, but the iron rest resembled a sauna. The cherry on top was that the view was ensured through
about four rectangular holes. Well, once we were in the statue, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to simply give up.
Using last forces I took a picture of people at the very top and put lens also into holes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
   &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals for the statue were different and initially each of them included a lot of Roman and Greek
elements. Finally, its design stabilised at the statue dressed in a bear fur holding a wreath of
oak leaves in the left hand with the Bavarian lion on the right. The building behind the statue
represents the Hall of Fame and there are plenty of busts of known scientists, writers and so on.
The area for Oktoberfest is great and the subway exit leads directly into the area, which I found
extremely practical :). Celebrations in Munich began first time due to the wedding of the Prince
Ludwig of Bavaria and Princess Therese at the beginning of October 1810. As part of the
celebrations horse racing was organised and in honor of the princess, this place was named after
her Theresienwiese (Therese&amp;rsquo;s meadow). Since then, the celebrations were held every year. Firstly,
horses were sold, later refreshment stands were added and various artists came and the celebrations
somehow remain until today but with beer, sausages and so on. And this year the Bicentenary will be
celebrated and all the brewers said they created together some great beer specially for this
occasion, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/04/29/surfers</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had our first visitors here last weekend. Our friends came to see us and of course all the
beauties of Munich. On Sunday we went for walk to Englischer Garten. The weather was excellent,
sunny and very warm. We choose a different path as the first time to better know the park for
future visitors and we came to the stream Eisbach (ice stream). Well, we&amp;rsquo;ve read about one place in the park, where people use to surf, but we&amp;rsquo;ve never seen this
place before. Actually, it was something I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even imagine that would be possible. But after
several minutes of standing on the bridge and watching some guys trying to hold themselves on the
big wave of the stream, I realised that it&amp;rsquo;s really possible:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only sign near the stream was that swimming is prohibited, so I suggest surfing is something
completely different :) And I&amp;rsquo;m really glad that there is this kind of attraction, because it&amp;rsquo;s
great for watching.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My lovely husband sent me again several pictures from our flat surrounding and honestly, I was a
little bit jealous. I wish I were there and could build a snowman :)That narrow path is going toward S-Bahn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>English garden</title>
      <link>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2009/11/25/english-garden</link>

      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2009/11/25/english-garden</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I have no idea why this park is called Englischer Garten (English garden). Maybe
because it is well-adjusted with properly cut lawn and pretty paths. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the world&amp;rsquo;s
largest public parks and it&amp;rsquo;s also obviously very popular for relax and walking, doing some sports
or just for sitting and reading a book. This park actually reminded me the Central Park in
Manhattan, but this one is even larger.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
   &lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The only thing we knew about the park when we entered it was that there is the Chinesischer Turm
(Chinese Tower). We noticed also the map with all the paths and important points on it and we
agreed that we could cross whole the park, look for the tower and then go by U-Bahn back to town
centre. It was really nice walking and warm sunny weather. We also discovered a Greek style temple
called Monopteros (Apollo temple) on a little hill, which was created artificially as I read later
and a little waterfall, which is actually used by surfers, when there is a lot of water.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a style=&#34;display:inline-block;&#34; class=&#34;fancybox&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ajka-andrej.com/wp-content/gallery/germany/munich/englischergarten/IMG_0031.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;group1&#34;&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
        &lt;a style=&#34;display:inline-block;&#34; class=&#34;fancybox&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ajka-andrej.com/wp-content/gallery/germany/munich/englischergarten/IMG_0040.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;group1&#34;&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
   &lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;So we finally came to the Chinese tower. There were lot of people who were working on building
wooden kiosks for christmas market and some of them decorated the big tree. Some of the kiosks were
already opened and offered people sausages and beer. Since my lovely husband promised me to buy me
a beer called weissbier, we stayed there for a while and enjoyed the beer and the atmosphere of the
park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, just to defence myself; I know that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like, but I really didn&amp;rsquo;t drink it all by
myself, Andrej helped me a lot :). Since we thought that we are somewhere in the middle of the
park, we approached the closest map to check the rest of our way. At that point we realised that we
are only in the first quarter of the park and that the first map we saw was only first half of the
park. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that this park is one of our most favourite places in Munich and I will
have many opportunities to take a lot of other pictures and finally see all the parts of the park.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where to go with visitors</title>
      <link>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2009/11/25/where-to-go-with-visitors</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2009 15:42:01 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2009/11/25/where-to-go-with-visitors</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were thinking about where to go in Munich. We had a nice weather and 3-days ticket for
travelling, so I took the map and was looking for some interesting places in the wider centre of
the Munich. Since I wanted to take some impresive pictures, we went to the Nymphenburg castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the castle is really impresive, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about the pictures. As it is the beginning of
the winter, all the statues were covered by the wooden boxes, fountains were not working and in
general it was obviously a good time to repair everything. And as we were walking an interesting
idea occured to us; if there is someone, who will visit us in between April and October, we will be
happy to show him this place :). But I don&amp;rsquo;t regret that we walked there, I think it&amp;rsquo;s worthy to
see it anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we went to Olympia park. Have I already mentioned that it is good time to repair and tidy
up everything this time of year? Well, the big artificial lake was without the water and was in the
process of cleaning. But the park was amazing anyway and I am sure we will return there for another
nice walk. It&amp;rsquo;s actually another good place for our future visitors :)as there is 290 m high tower
with beautiful views of the entire Munich. There is the lift in the tower, which will take you up
to 185 m. On that floor you can watch everything through the windows, on which simple schemes are
described so you actually know where and what you are looking at. Then there are another two
floors, where you need to go by stairs, but there is only railing and you can take some nice
panoramas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the first panorama made by Andrej, so I expect many comments how nice it is :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never been to Munich before and I feel those few days I spent there weren&amp;rsquo;t enough. I love
the historical flair of this city. There are no high modern glass buildings preventing the sun
shine to the street, but low stylish buildings with sloping red roofs. There are loads of bakery and little kiosks with pretzels everywhere. Since I love to ramble
marketplace, what I have probably inherited from my daddy, I was unbelievable happy to see one
directly in the city centre called Viktualienmarkt. It was said to me that it is little bit
expensive, but it had the right atmosphere, especially now before the Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        
   &lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;We of course didn&amp;rsquo;t miss the square Marienplatz and Glockenspiel there. It was lovely watching of
dancing figures and all the moving things with the melodic bells ringing. Since it last several
minutes I took a few short videos and I hope you will like them. There were quite a lot of people
waiting for this little performance prepared with their cameras and as we noticed it was also good
places for clever guys who offered town guiding in different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
