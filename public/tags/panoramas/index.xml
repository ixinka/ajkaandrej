      <description>There are already many articles about this hill on our web page and I need to say that it&amp;rsquo;s one of our favourite hill. But two weeks ago, we had such a nice visit, to my great pleasure longing for trips led by a almost three years old young tourist. And so we went on trips to many places and one of them was Wallberg. It&amp;rsquo;s clear to me that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to convince Andrej to go there otherwise (certainly not in November and not at all in that snow except the sledding).</description>

      <description>This was the only trip (not counting the local trips in the forest and cycling), which we managed to do during the summer. I planned more of them, but thanks to my incredible fatigue, I was glad that we were able to get at least here. Kampenwand itself is a rocky hill with a cross at the very top (the largest one in the Bavarian Alps), but the name is used to identify all the surrounding tourist area with lots of hiking routes, cottages and chapels.</description>

      <description>This year, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide where to go on holiday. My usual desire for trips became unbalanced due to the work fatigue and it was replaced by a new desire (very unusual for me) to go to sea on a beautiful sandy beach and at most to make a trip to some of the local restaurants for culinary specialties. Andrej couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe his ears (after all those years with me, he has experienced many things but he only dreamed quietly about such a vacation with me when we became a couple) and a sudden panic seized him, what we&amp;rsquo;re actually going to do there.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, we went skiing again. This time we chose Sudelfeld ski resort. Our colleague told us that it is a little bit small and local, but less people know about it and therefore it usually is not so crowded on Saturday. The weather was absolutely fantastic, there were really not so many people and we were quite surprised when we found that it is not as small as we heard. In addition, it is a great place for skiing with children with lots of children&amp;rsquo;s short and mild slopes and help with all lifts.</description>

      <description>We went sledding during our Christmas holiday to relax and spend our time wisely :) Here are some pictures from the last year. This time, we set off earlier and so we basically had the whole track for ourselves. I tried to make some videos during the sledding ( on steeper sections it&amp;rsquo;s a bit shaky because I had to brake too). The experience was again absolutely terrific. In between, we refreshed ourselves in the panorama restaurant on the hill, warmed up on the sun and I took a panorama from that beautiful view around.</description>

      <description>Another Oktoberfest (or Wiesn as local people would say) behind us, and this year we didn&amp;rsquo;t miss it. Well, we didn&amp;rsquo;t join the official event in traditional clothes inside one of the huge tents, but we dived in the great atmosphere and we drank one litter of beer. We didn&amp;rsquo;t see the initial ceremony this year, because we weren&amp;rsquo;t in the mood to go to the town in a rainy weather, but we did spent some hours together with our colleagues drinking beer at Oktoberfest.</description>

      <description>Finally, we went on a tour we had already planned for early summer. Somehow, it always rained or we were not at home and so I could only study our route theoretically. But last week we had an ideal weather and so we set off on the trip in the morning. We parked next to the cable-car station just outside the village Osterhofen and then we hiked three hours and three quarters up the hill Wendelstein 1838 m (at least we thought so according to a tourist guide, in fact, we went up two and half hours).</description>

      <description>Recently, we spent some time searching for a new apartment and beside this activity we discovered various places where we haven&amp;rsquo;t previously been. We were fascinated by one such a district town at very first visit and so we went there during one weekend again to get to know it a little bit more. We already get used to the plane everywhere in Munich (I don&amp;rsquo;t count those few artificial hills there) and we were very pleasantly surprised by the hilly terrain of the town.</description>

      <title>Nature trip</title>

      <description>Since urban tourism is quite difficult, and as we don&amp;rsquo;t want to destroy our visitors (we would like them to come again), we have always at hand some trip to nature. Neither last Saturday it was different and we went to our quite favourite place, on the hill Wallberg. Up and down we drove a cable-car, but then we hiked to the top of the peak (about half an hour). The chapel, which was reconstructed is already nice and finished.</description>

      <description>We were already several times in the Olympia park, but we somehow never got to the highest hill there. To walk on its top is not really difficult, but either the weather didn&amp;rsquo;t work out for us, or we were already tired from walking through the town so we ended up just resting near the lake below. There is a nice paved walkway leading up to the top of the hill that is great view point as well.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, we went on a trip to the lake Walchensee. It&amp;rsquo;s about an hour from our home by car in a beautiful environment surrounded by the mountains. This time we didn&amp;rsquo;t go alone, but we took our visitors as well. The weather was amazing and was also pleasantly warm although, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t warm enough to melt all the snow on the hills above. Near the lake we took a cable-car and we travelled four minutes about 800 meters higher.</description>

      <description>This is another option (not counting the Tyrolean Alps around the corner) to go skiing when you are in Grainau. And not only that. Cable cars operate here also in the summer and there is a wide variety of hiking trails offered by the hills.
    One of the black slopes was closed due to the preparation for the World Championships (5a on the slope plan), but we didn&amp;rsquo;t miss it at all.</description>

      <description>I must say that this place is simply wonderful. We haven&amp;rsquo;t been to Zugspitze (the highest peak in Germany, 2962m), because we somehow couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop skiing in such a beautiful weather. But we agreed that we would make this trip in the summer.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve never really thought about the name of the peak until now, when I found out that you can go just below it by train (der Zug).</description>

      <description>Last weekend, we took advantage of a good weather after a long week of snowing and went sledding. We&amp;rsquo;ve already been on the Wallberg hill for hiking before. This time we used the cable-car on the way up and we sledded down the hill.
We borrowed sleds each separately, but later we agreed that next time we&amp;rsquo;ll sled together as it requires an appropriate weight. Andrej was faster and he didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;fly&amp;rdquo; after each bump on the road.</description>

      <description>anniversary of the Oktoberfest is over and people in traditional costumes are slowly but surely disappearing from the streets and the subway, so people like us dressed only in jeans and T-shirt don&amp;rsquo;t look like tourists anymore.  Although we haven&amp;rsquo;t been in the beer tent on the Theresienwiese, we didn&amp;rsquo;t miss parade at the launch of this year&amp;rsquo;s festivities. There were horse drawn carts with barrels of beer and venison, but also agricultural machinery and many brass bands.</description>

      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/08/24/wallberg/</guid>
      <description>This time we went a little higher on the hill Wallberg (1722m) and so we increased the elevation to 927m. To get there, we travelled around the Tegernsee lake, which looked beautiful from above. We parked next to the cable-car station and began hiking. You can find more pictures in the gallery.
 Right at the beginning of our journey, we found out that the first cottage, where we wanted to go, was closed (on the winter version of the route) and so we decided that we would take it up with a bit steeper but shorter summer route.</description>

      <description>So finally, we made one of our planned trips ( I have 37 more trips in my tourist guide :)). Although in Munich the weather was nice and sunny, 40 minutes southern by our car led to mountains covered by clouds. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t discouraged us and we set off on the path leading us around the lake Schliersee.
 The environment there was really beautiful. It is possible to rent a boat there and we also found the Wellness centre with a swimming pool, slides, sauna and so on.</description>

      <title>On the way to Slovakia and back</title>

      <description>As a part of running in our new car we went to Slovakia. All the traffic jams somehow managed to escape or be removed, until we got to them. And given the rainy weather, we had no taste to stop anywhere making a break, so after six hours we arrived to our destination. Lights were turned on automatically, wipers as well as appropriate, Andrej pretty much just pressed buttons of cruise control until Bratislava and in the meanwhile I studied controlling of theair-conditioning andsurroundingbuttons.</description>

      <title>Where to go with visitors</title>

      <description>We were thinking about where to go in Munich. We had a nice weather and 3-days ticket for travelling, so I took the map and was looking for some interesting places in the wider centre of the Munich. Since I wanted to take some impresive pictures, we went to the Nymphenburg castle.
Well the castle is really impresive, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about the pictures. As it is the beginning of the winter, all the statues were covered by the wooden boxes, fountains were not working and in general it was obviously a good time to repair everything.</description>

      <description>My two friends were in New York at the end of September and it remained me that I have two more panorama pictures from the &amp;ldquo;big apple&amp;rdquo;. I took them at the top of the Rockefeller Centre. Although I need to say that I prefer the beautiful views from the top of hills not from buildings, these place was amazing.
 There were many people as everywhere, but we could move freely and took pictures of whatever we wanted.</description>

      <description>Finally, after a long time of promising, we visited Miško and Ivka in faraway America. We set off at four in the morning, so we could catch a flight from Vienna ( I&amp;rsquo;m really thankful that I have so great parents, that they got up so early and gave us a lift there). We flew with a very small planeto Dusseldorf, where we had a famous pretzel, coffee and I bought a big package of Haribogummibears.</description>

      <description>Funchal is the biggest town of Madeira and its centre was about six kilometers from our hotel which was walkable distance. There are many restaurants, shopping areas, museums and parks where you can spend lovely time. The only thing is that this town is a little bit noisy now, because they are building many hotels and block of flats everywhere. That was one of the reasons why to stay in a hotel in a quiet and peacefull place away from the town.</description>

      <description>One way how to get known some part of this beautiful island is to go for a bus trip and travel across the mountains and along the coast. We saw so many beautiful things, untouched nature, traditional houses, completely different land in the north part and in the south. Once you go up through the layer of clouds after the forest, mountains appear before your eyes and you feel like in a paradise.</description>

      <description>This is the town were we lived in a wonderful hotel Corona, which we can only recommend. It is said to be the most visited place by tourists on the island. It has several beaches (we saw and tried all of them), nice centre, several churches and countless streets, which are worth walking. This town is also famous by wine production and amazing thermal park Poseidon gardens.The most famous church is Soccorso&amp;rsquo;s church devoted to Santa Naria delle Neve, which can be seen in the movie Avanti!</description>
