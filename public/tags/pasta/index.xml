      <description>Last time I wrote how to make a pasta dough and I dreamed about the tortellini. Than I tried to make this lovely pasta again and considering a very tasty result, I bring this recipe to you :) Make the filling first, than prepare the dough according to the instructions here (this way the dough will not becomedry while you preparing the other things.), but use thickness 9 for the final dough sheet.</description>

      <description>Tortellini belong to my favourite dishes. I have even a very good recipe for stuffing, but when I tried to prepare it last time, it reminded me more pirohy than tortellini. The problem was in a dough, it was too solid and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t roll it thin enough as well. And so I said that I would have to buy a pasta maker at some point. This Christmas, a pasta maker appeared in our kitchen and so I began to produce pasta.</description>

      <description>When one is desperate, they make weird decisions. Thanks to that I somehow came to this recipe. Suddenly, we had a lot of zucchini and after cooking zucchini sauce, pancakes and potatoes with zucchini I had no idea what to do with the rest of it. I slightly modified the original pasta recipe:
     href=&amp;ldquo;http://www.ajka-andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_0029.jpg&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Ingredients (for four persons): {{ 1&amp;frasl;2 box Barilla Maccheroni pasta 4 PL Extra Virgin olive oil 3 cloves chopped garlic 1&amp;frasl;2 large zucchini (sliced with peeler) 3 big tomatoes chopped to cubes salt, ground black pepper to taste full hand of chopped fresh basil leaves grated cheese on top }} Instructions: Cook pasta according to instructions on the box (you cannot really overcook this pasta, it became our favourite in Italy few years ago and since then we&amp;rsquo;ve used only this one).</description>
