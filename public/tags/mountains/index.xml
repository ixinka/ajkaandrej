      <title>November Wallberg</title>

      <description>There are already many articles about this hill on our web page and I need to say that it&amp;rsquo;s one of our favourite hill. But two weeks ago, we had such a nice visit, to my great pleasure longing for trips led by a almost three years old young tourist. And so we went on trips to many places and one of them was Wallberg. It&amp;rsquo;s clear to me that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to convince Andrej to go there otherwise (certainly not in November and not at all in that snow except the sledding).</description>

      <description>This was the only trip (not counting the local trips in the forest and cycling), which we managed to do during the summer. I planned more of them, but thanks to my incredible fatigue, I was glad that we were able to get at least here. Kampenwand itself is a rocky hill with a cross at the very top (the largest one in the Bavarian Alps), but the name is used to identify all the surrounding tourist area with lots of hiking routes, cottages and chapels.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, we went skiing again. This time we chose Sudelfeld ski resort. Our colleague told us that it is a little bit small and local, but less people know about it and therefore it usually is not so crowded on Saturday. The weather was absolutely fantastic, there were really not so many people and we were quite surprised when we found that it is not as small as we heard. In addition, it is a great place for skiing with children with lots of children&amp;rsquo;s short and mild slopes and help with all lifts.</description>

      <description>We went sledding during our Christmas holiday to relax and spend our time wisely :) Here are some pictures from the last year. This time, we set off earlier and so we basically had the whole track for ourselves. I tried to make some videos during the sledding ( on steeper sections it&amp;rsquo;s a bit shaky because I had to brake too). The experience was again absolutely terrific. In between, we refreshed ourselves in the panorama restaurant on the hill, warmed up on the sun and I took a panorama from that beautiful view around.</description>

      <description>Finally, we went on a tour we had already planned for early summer. Somehow, it always rained or we were not at home and so I could only study our route theoretically. But last week we had an ideal weather and so we set off on the trip in the morning. We parked next to the cable-car station just outside the village Osterhofen and then we hiked three hours and three quarters up the hill Wendelstein 1838 m (at least we thought so according to a tourist guide, in fact, we went up two and half hours).</description>

      <description>Since urban tourism is quite difficult, and as we don&amp;rsquo;t want to destroy our visitors (we would like them to come again), we have always at hand some trip to nature. Neither last Saturday it was different and we went to our quite favourite place, on the hill Wallberg. Up and down we drove a cable-car, but then we hiked to the top of the peak (about half an hour). The chapel, which was reconstructed is already nice and finished.</description>

      <description>Last Friday we went to Easter trip. We had a beautiful warm weather, around 25 degrees and I saw a newspaper tip for a nice trip to a waterfall. I thought that in this lovely April weather everything is melting and so there could be a lot of water. After a small survey, I found two other even bigger waterfalls near the original one. From parking places it was up to 20 minutes walk to each one and so we decided to see all of them.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, we went on a trip to the lake Walchensee. It&amp;rsquo;s about an hour from our home by car in a beautiful environment surrounded by the mountains. This time we didn&amp;rsquo;t go alone, but we took our visitors as well. The weather was amazing and was also pleasantly warm although, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t warm enough to melt all the snow on the hills above. Near the lake we took a cable-car and we travelled four minutes about 800 meters higher.</description>

      <description>This is another option (not counting the Tyrolean Alps around the corner) to go skiing when you are in Grainau. And not only that. Cable cars operate here also in the summer and there is a wide variety of hiking trails offered by the hills.
    One of the black slopes was closed due to the preparation for the World Championships (5a on the slope plan), but we didn&amp;rsquo;t miss it at all.</description>

      <description>I must say that this place is simply wonderful. We haven&amp;rsquo;t been to Zugspitze (the highest peak in Germany, 2962m), because we somehow couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop skiing in such a beautiful weather. But we agreed that we would make this trip in the summer.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve never really thought about the name of the peak until now, when I found out that you can go just below it by train (der Zug).</description>

      <title>Holiday in Grainau</title>
      <link>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2011/01/30/holiday-in-grainau/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2011/01/30/holiday-in-grainau/</guid>
      <description>This time we traveled only about an hour and a quarter by car from our home to the village Grainau. We wanted to ski and get to know our surroundings better. We stayed in a very nice and cozy house with a great breakfast (Gasthaus Geigener). The weather was quite good, we skied whole the week except the two days and my darling named our vacation week assembly.
     One snowy day, we made a train trip to the nearby Tyrol village Lermoos and then we went back to Garmisch Partenkirchen, where we found a great Italian restaurant for lunch and we saw the ski springboard and slopes for the upcoming World Championships.</description>

      <title>Skiing in Laax</title>

      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2011/01/10/skiing-in-laax/</guid>
      <description>This year I made several New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions (I will sometimes write about them). One of them is to ski this winter properly. Before Christmas, we decided to visit our friends in Switzerland and we were going to look at several ski resorts near Zurich. But this plan failed, because during our planned weekend heat wave arrived from Spain and at 1100 m it was suddenly 7 degrees. Finally, we opted for the more distant, but higher placed resort Laax, where we were skiing at around 2500 m at a pleasant temperature just below zero.</description>

      <title>Sledding</title>

      <description>Last weekend, we took advantage of a good weather after a long week of snowing and went sledding. We&amp;rsquo;ve already been on the Wallberg hill for hiking before. This time we used the cable-car on the way up and we sledded down the hill.
We borrowed sleds each separately, but later we agreed that next time we&amp;rsquo;ll sled together as it requires an appropriate weight. Andrej was faster and he didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;fly&amp;rdquo; after each bump on the road.</description>

      <title>Wallberg</title>

      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/08/24/wallberg/</guid>
      <description>This time we went a little higher on the hill Wallberg (1722m) and so we increased the elevation to 927m. To get there, we travelled around the Tegernsee lake, which looked beautiful from above. We parked next to the cable-car station and began hiking. You can find more pictures in the gallery.
 Right at the beginning of our journey, we found out that the first cottage, where we wanted to go, was closed (on the winter version of the route) and so we decided that we would take it up with a bit steeper but shorter summer route.</description>

      <description>So finally, we made one of our planned trips ( I have 37 more trips in my tourist guide :)). Although in Munich the weather was nice and sunny, 40 minutes southern by our car led to mountains covered by clouds. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t discouraged us and we set off on the path leading us around the lake Schliersee.
 The environment there was really beautiful. It is possible to rent a boat there and we also found the Wellness centre with a swimming pool, slides, sauna and so on.</description>

      <title>A trip toward lakes</title>

      <description>Finally, after two and half months, I and Andrej have been together again and as we got the car for a couple of days, we decided to go for a trip somewhere. However, the parking in Munich is not the best idea and we wanted to use the car more useful, so we drove toward two lakes near Munich - Starnberg See and Walchensee. Starnberg See is the second largest lake in Bavaria.</description>

      <description>As we have been together again for a little bit longer time than usual, we decided to go somewhere for a nice trip. This time we chose mountains Male Karpaty with the aim to go to the highest hill Zaruby (768 m). And to make this trip more interesting, we visited ruins of two castles on the road. On Saturday morning we travelled to Plavecke Podhradie, where our trip began and after 20 minutes of hiking we could observe ruins of the first castle Plavecky hrad.</description>

      <title>Trips through the Ischia</title>

      <description>You can make as many trips as you want on this island and you will still find some other places where to go. I can say that one week is not long enough for it. If you like hiking you need to see the vulcan which is responsible for all the thermal springs around the island. The name of the vulcan is Monte Epomeo and it is still active but it is not seen outwardly (except the springs).</description>
