      <description>We spent last two Wednesdays skiing in neighbouring Tyrol in the ski resort Wilder Kaiser. Every time we parked in another town, we went to the highest possible place by a cable car and then we skied cross over the hills everywhere where we could get by the ski lifts. The weather was absolutely fantastic and I took some pictures as well.

      <description>As a part of running in our new car we went to Slovakia. All the traffic jams somehow managed to escape or be removed, until we got to them. And given the rainy weather, we had no taste to stop anywhere making a break, so after six hours we arrived to our destination. Lights were turned on automatically, wipers as well as appropriate, Andrej pretty much just pressed buttons of cruise control until Bratislava and in the meanwhile I studied controlling of theair-conditioning andsurroundingbuttons.</description>
