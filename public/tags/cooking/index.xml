      <description>Last time I wrote how to make a pasta dough and I dreamed about the tortellini. Than I tried to make this lovely pasta again and considering a very tasty result, I bring this recipe to you :) Make the filling first, than prepare the dough according to the instructions here (this way the dough will not becomedry while you preparing the other things.), but use thickness 9 for the final dough sheet.</description>

      <description>When one is desperate, they make weird decisions. Thanks to that I somehow came to this recipe. Suddenly, we had a lot of zucchini and after cooking zucchini sauce, pancakes and potatoes with zucchini I had no idea what to do with the rest of it. I slightly modified the original pasta recipe:
     href=&amp;ldquo;http://www.ajka-andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_0029.jpg&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Ingredients (for four persons): {{ 1&amp;frasl;2 box Barilla Maccheroni pasta 4 PL Extra Virgin olive oil 3 cloves chopped garlic 1&amp;frasl;2 large zucchini (sliced with peeler) 3 big tomatoes chopped to cubes salt, ground black pepper to taste full hand of chopped fresh basil leaves grated cheese on top }} Instructions: Cook pasta according to instructions on the box (you cannot really overcook this pasta, it became our favourite in Italy few years ago and since then we&amp;rsquo;ve used only this one).</description>

      <description>Generally, a man, who has lived abroad for longer time, usually finds out that he lacks some food or ingredient, which he would otherwise get on every corner in his native country, but in a foreign country there is no rumour or even hearing about it. In England, I somehow got used to the fact that poppy seeds are considered as dangerous drugs, the proper bread could be found in a Polish shop, cheese selection was a little bit limited and the overall problem was to find anything not low fat.</description>
