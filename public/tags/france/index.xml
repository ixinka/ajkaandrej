      <description>The reason why I came to Laval wasinternational conference about virtual and augmented reality with about 200 people. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why this event was held in this town, somewhere in the centre of France in very countryside. It was something to think about even for French visitors, at least for those few who spoke to me in english. On the other hand, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t probably have other reason to go there, so I suggest it was kind of propagation of this locality.</description>

      <description>Finally, I visited Paris, the city considered as a one of the most romantic places in the world or at least in the Europe. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I don&amp;rsquo;t need to go there to have a perfect romantic atmosphere, but it is a nice place, worthy of visiting. What I enjoyed the most were trees on each street and loads of small parks everywhere. Typical French buildings with little balconies with metal railings, small caf√©s with outdoor sections and of course bakeries with fresh baguettes made this town somehow special.</description>
