      <description>We discovered this sweet meal at Wallberg. First time, we ordered it just to try what it tastes like (since then only on purpose :)). Then I looked for some good recipe and how to prepare it and now I use this slightly modified recipe from the LandLeben magazine.
     Ingredients: {{ 220 g flour (plain one used for pancakes) 8 egg yolks 8 egg whites 400 ml milk (or in combination with whipped cream) 2 tbsp sugar pinch of salt butter to bake a handful of raisins (can be soaked in rum) icing sugar for decoration applesauce for dipping }} Instructions: Mix the egg yolks with sugar and salt.</description>

      <description>Last time I wrote how to make a pasta dough and I dreamed about the tortellini. Than I tried to make this lovely pasta again and considering a very tasty result, I bring this recipe to you :) Make the filling first, than prepare the dough according to the instructions here (this way the dough will not becomedry while you preparing the other things.), but use thickness 9 for the final dough sheet.</description>

      <description>Tortellini belong to my favourite dishes. I have even a very good recipe for stuffing, but when I tried to prepare it last time, it reminded me more pirohy than tortellini. The problem was in a dough, it was too solid and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t roll it thin enough as well. And so I said that I would have to buy a pasta maker at some point. This Christmas, a pasta maker appeared in our kitchen and so I began to produce pasta.</description>

      <description>This is one of those recipes, which confirmsthat beauty is in simplicity.It&amp;rsquo;s fast, easy and the result is very tasty. Thanks to my colleague&amp;rsquo;s wife for this wonderful recipe.
      Ingredients: {{ pastry (ready to use sheet can be bought) 150g ground walnuts or almonds 75g sugar 1 egg Amaretto (almond liquor) }} Instructions: Preheat the oven to 200 C or gas mark 6. Prepare the baking paper (a rectangle that fits your baking tray).</description>

      <title>Apple-poppy strudel</title>
      <link>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2011/11/08/apple-poppy-strudel/</link>

      <description>A strudel is one of my most favourite cakes.The best thing about it is that it can be prepared as quick as it can be eaten. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of cheating because I don&amp;rsquo;t count the making of a pastry. Making the proper strudel dough as my grandma used to make, by slogging it on the table and pulling it so that she got a paper-thin cloth, is only my secret desire, which I&amp;rsquo;ll be maybe able to fulfil at some point in the future.</description>

      <description>This recipe I have to spread further because it&amp;rsquo;s amazing. I got it from my supervisor&amp;rsquo;s wife in England. She made them for me and Andrej when we visited them during my graduation. I think we both felt in love with these great muffins, so here is the recipe:
  Ingredients (for 12 muffins): {{ 2 and half small ripe bananas or 2 bigger ones 125ml sunflower oil 2 eggs 100g brown sugar 225g plain flour 3 tbsp cocoa powder 1 tsp baking powder }} Instructions: Preheat the oven to 200 C (150 C for fan oven) or gas mark 6.</description>

      <title>Macaroni with zucchini and tomatoes</title>

      <description>When one is desperate, they make weird decisions. Thanks to that I somehow came to this recipe. Suddenly, we had a lot of zucchini and after cooking zucchini sauce, pancakes and potatoes with zucchini I had no idea what to do with the rest of it. I slightly modified the original pasta recipe:
     href=&amp;ldquo;http://www.ajka-andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_0029.jpg&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Ingredients (for four persons): {{ 1&amp;frasl;2 box Barilla Maccheroni pasta 4 PL Extra Virgin olive oil 3 cloves chopped garlic 1&amp;frasl;2 large zucchini (sliced with peeler) 3 big tomatoes chopped to cubes salt, ground black pepper to taste full hand of chopped fresh basil leaves grated cheese on top }} Instructions: Cook pasta according to instructions on the box (you cannot really overcook this pasta, it became our favourite in Italy few years ago and since then we&amp;rsquo;ve used only this one).</description>

      <title>Crustless spinach quiche</title>

      <guid>https://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/12/03/crustless-spinach-quiche/</guid>
      <description>This is one of those recipes, which are really easy to prepare and it is also a nice opportunity for the spinach to be spent :). I did many changes to the original recipe. However, I think there are still loads of possibilities for improvements and adaptation to different tastes.
   Ingredients (for 24cm baking form): (general stuff) {{ 1&amp;frasl;2 cup flour 1&amp;frasl;2 cup creme fraiche (I usually use the whole 200g package) 1 cup milk (I use finely shredded potatoes for the richer version instead) 4 eggs butter for greasing }} (to taste) It can be whatever you like - chopped zucchini, tomatoes, salami, broccoli, cauliflower &amp;hellip; The mass all together should fit into 1 and 1&amp;frasl;2 cup.</description>

      <description>Muffins are those cakes, perfect for guests, which are very tasty,look great and it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to bake them. I have two simple recipes that work great for me. One is from my English friend Kate and the other one is from one book about muffins I bought in England. I use one of them when I have some frozen berries and the second one for sweet fresh fruit or dried fruit.</description>

      <description>My husband is not really very enthusiast for cakes eating and it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes very difficult to bake a good cake for him. Once we were skiing at Snow Paradise Velka Raca in Slovakia. It was lovely day, not too many people around and we were pretty tired and hungry, so we decided to sit down in one of the local buffet. We bought sausages with bread, tea and coffe and then we noticed cute baked &amp;ldquo;parcels&amp;rdquo; sprinkled with ice sugar.</description>

      <title>bábovka (sponge cake)</title>

      <description>Well, I promised to give some recipes to several people, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that it&amp;rsquo;ll be much easier to have a special category in blogs just for that :)The first one is more about baking than cooking, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll love it specially with coffee or hot chocolate for breakfast. The original name is bábovka and it is kind of sponge cake. It is usually baked in a round form with a hole in the centre, so the cake has a nice shape and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to slice it.</description>
