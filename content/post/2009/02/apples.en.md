My husband is not really very enthusiast for cakes eating and it's sometimes very difficult to bake
a good cake for him. Once we were skiing at Snow Paradise Velka Raca in Slovakia. It was lovely
day, not too many people around and we were pretty tired and hungry, so we decided to sit down in
one of the local buffet. We bought sausages with bread, tea and coffe and then we noticed cute
baked "parcels" sprinkled with ice sugar. It looked lovely and we knew that we need to try how it taste :). The parcel was called Apple in
the dressing gown and it was basically just the apple with some jam and raisins inside, wraped up
in the pastry and sprinkled with the ice sugar, but Andrej loved it and it was the very first cake
I made after coming home.

**Ingredients:**  

* several middle sized whole apples (peeled without the centre and seeds)
* 3 tbsp of good jam (the flavour depends on you)
* raisins
* 1 tsp of ground cinnamon
* breadcrumb
* pastry
* 1 egg yolk
* ice sugar for icing
* cloves

**Directions:**  
Roll out the pastry into large sheet around 1/2 cm thin with the rolling pin or buy already prepared
pastry sheet. Mix jam with raisins and cinnamon in the bowl. Cut the pastry sheet to several
squares big enough for each apple. Sprinkle the part of the square where the apple will be with
breadcrumb and put the apple on it. Fill the centre of the apple with jam mixture. Wrap the apple
up with the pastry square by sticking the opposite corners together. Join all four edges together
with clove.

Spread the baking tray with the butter and put several apple parcels on it. Brush parcels with egg
yolk. Bake until the colour of pastry is nice gold brown on the gass mark 5 about 20 minutes. Cool
on the baking tray and then enjoy. Apple should be soft for eating and it is ussualy soft enough
after baking, but if you wish you can put it in the microwave for a while.
