Well, I promised to give some recipes to several people, so I've decided that it'll be much easier
to have a special category in blogs just for that :)The first one is more about baking than
cooking, but I'm sure you'll love it specially with coffee or hot chocolate for breakfast. The original name is **bábovka** and it is kind of sponge cake. It is usually baked in a round form
with a hole in the centre, so the cake has a nice shape and it's easy to slice it.But you can use
any form you want. During the Christmas I baked it in the tree shaped form and it was wonderfull
and symbolic as well.

smooth. Stir baking powder into the flour and add it to eggs mixture in the bowl. Add water, oil
and vanilla sugar, stirring just until combined. Whisk white of eggs and stir it lightly into the
mixture (don't use electric device for it ! ). Spread the baking form with butter and sprinkle it
with flour. Poor half of the mixture to the baking form. Stir cocoa powder into the second half in
the bowl. Then poor rest of the mixture into the form. Bake until a cake tester inserted into
center comes out fairly clean, about 20 minutes on gass mark 5. Good advice is not tto open the
oven at least first 15 minutes. Cool in the form, then tip the cake out on the tray or plate and
enjoy.
