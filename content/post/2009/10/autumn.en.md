To say "it's autumn" is not really up to date information, especially when at some places in
Slovakia is already snowing. But I think this part of year is the most beautiful in England with
the most stable weather as well and I couldn't help myself taking some lovely pictures.

Above the fourth tree from right side in the second row of windows is approximately the place where
I work :). The reason why I took picture of that little tree is that is somehow special. It is
memorial tree and we planted it in the middle of October near our building since it were two years
our colleague and friend tragically passed away.It happened at very beginning when I came here, so
I didn't have opportunity to know him very well, but he was nice guy and it is a pity he is no
longer among us.
