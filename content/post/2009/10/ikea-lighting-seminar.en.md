I attended another IKEA seminar. This time, it was about furnishing with light, from needs to task
solutions.

First, I though I would miss the beginning of the seminar because my train was delayed as usual, but
I finally managed to be on time and I relished nice English breakfast at the top floor of IKEA. We
had very nice presentation about the role of light, different light sources and examples how to use
light in different rooms for various purposes. Afterwards, we walked through individual showrooms
and paid attention to many groups of lamps, talking about the purposes and importance of their
placement. We discuss some safety rules as well and were interested in energy saving bulbs. Ikea
guys were very nice and patient in answering and I had another great morning full of fun and
enjoyable information.
