I visited another English town, called Bradford. I spent around three hours by travelling by train
so I had enough time to find out more about the cathedral, shopping centres, main square and the
University of Bradford where I went for conference.

The town was quite nice and I had good weather as well (surprisingly :)). The only thing I didn't
expect was that I felt a little bit like I was in Near East as I met many Arabic guys and I saw
many specialised shops with clothes and food typical for that countries. I only found later that
English people call this town a new Pakistan. The nice advantage for tourists is a free bus, which
makes the circuit around the town centre and stops on every important place.
