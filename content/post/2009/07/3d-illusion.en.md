I had a lot of time to think about new features in the virtual baby project during the London expo.
There were many people who tried the application and gave me a nice feedback. Well, I got some ideas how to improve whole thing. One of the biggest problem in the environment was
that the user miss the depth, so it's sometimes difficult to say where the spoon is in the space.
We had a little brain storming :)with Andrej and the application provides user with stereoscopic 3D
effect using the anaglyph image. Well, simply said, you need to watch the virtual baby with two
colour glasses (red and cyan) to get 3D illusion like in the cinema.
