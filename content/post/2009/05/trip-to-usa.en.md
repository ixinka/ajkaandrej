Finally, after a long time of promising, we visited Mi≈°ko and Ivka in faraway America. We set off at
four in the morning, so we could catch a flight from Vienna ( I'm really thankful that I have so
great parents, that they got up so early and gave us a lift there). We flew with a very small
planeto Dusseldorf, where we had a famous pretzel, coffee and I bought a big package of
Haribogummibears. After the rest, we decided to go towards the large aircraft and the seven hour flight. My dear
husband slept all the way, I woke him up only several times when it was time to eat. I read
everything around, wrote a piece of paper and relished a large space in the aircraft, which was
amazing compared to the small planes, which I usually fly with. And then we saw the ground and
scattered houses through the window, and eventually a Statue of Liberty in the distance when we
were landing in New Jersey.

Once at the airport I found that the beautiful accent of british English is miles away from the
american English and I only tried to listen carefully to understand them. Of course, Andrej was
very happy with that as always. Second, this time our common observation was that everything was
huge there ... cars, roads, buildings, and most people, so we only watched everything. Then we
waited for a taxi with Ivka. Finally we got the taxi, which made strange sounds at very beginning
and it took us only a little bit from the airport, where we changed this odd car for a nice and
more comfortable one, which took us home.A 11th floor was high enough for my first panorama and the
view was really nice as well.
