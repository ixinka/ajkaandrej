Well, it sounds like from fairytale, but I talked to real prince :)Prince Andrew, the Duke of York
visited our Digital Lab to see what researchers are developing. He was very nice and smiling all the time. He watched all the prepared demos and listened to
individual researchers. I helped to my supervisor to set up everything for demonstration and I
stayed with him as crowd and support with no aim to speak about anything. But when the prince came
and my supervisor showed him the project about the virtual baby feeding I'm working on, he wanted
me to speak about it by myself. It made me really happy that he didn't pay attention just to big
professors, but also to ordinary students like me :)
