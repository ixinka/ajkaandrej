We were thinking about where to go in Munich. We had a nice weather and 3-days ticket for
travelling, so I took the map and was looking for some interesting places in the wider centre of
the Munich. Since I wanted to take some impresive pictures, we went to the Nymphenburg castle.



Well the castle is really impresive, but I'm not sure about the pictures. As it is the beginning of
the winter, all the statues were covered by the wooden boxes, fountains were not working and in
general it was obviously a good time to repair everything. And as we were walking an interesting
idea occured to us; if there is someone, who will visit us in between April and October, we will be
happy to show him this place :). But I don't regret that we walked there, I think it's worthy to
see it anytime.

Afterwards we went to Olympia park. Have I already mentioned that it is good time to repair and tidy
up everything this time of year? Well, the big artificial lake was without the water and was in the
process of cleaning. But the park was amazing anyway and I am sure we will return there for another
nice walk. It's actually another good place for our future visitors :)as there is 290 m high tower
with beautiful views of the entire Munich. There is the lift in the tower, which will take you up
to 185 m. On that floor you can watch everything through the windows, on which simple schemes are
described so you actually know where and what you are looking at. Then there are another two
floors, where you need to go by stairs, but there is only railing and you can take some nice
panoramas.

This is the first panorama made by Andrej, so I expect many comments how nice it is :)
