I have never been to Munich before and I feel those few days I spent there weren't enough. I love
the historical flair of this city. There are no high modern glass buildings preventing the sun
shine to the street, but low stylish buildings with sloping red roofs. There are loads of bakery and little kiosks with pretzels everywhere. Since I love to ramble
marketplace, what I have probably inherited from my daddy, I was unbelievable happy to see one
directly in the city centre called Viktualienmarkt. It was said to me that it is little bit
expensive, but it had the right atmosphere, especially now before the Christmas.

We of course didn't miss the square Marienplatz and Glockenspiel there. It was lovely watching of
dancing figures and all the moving things with the melodic bells ringing. Since it last several
minutes I took a few short videos and I hope you will like them. There were quite a lot of people
waiting for this little performance prepared with their cameras and as we noticed it was also good
places for clever guys who offered town guiding in different languages.
