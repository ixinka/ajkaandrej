This winter was somehow too short and now it looks again as in the springtime. We tried our best to make the most of it. Olivia tried to remember what the tobogganing is and
Dominik trained it as well. Beside this, Olivia enjoyed the evenings of fairy tales, she began to
"read" as others and she talks only about going to school.
