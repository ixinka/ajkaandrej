I always try to take my children outside in any weather and every time I say we are going 
out they both rush to the door. But sometimes I just want to be at home, it's raining, 
cold or dark early outside and then it is good to have a place where they can spend all 
their excess energy. So we made a gym in the basement. They can throw a ball there, 
slide, climb, boulder and chase each other. The result is hunger, fatigue and 
satisfaction on each side :)
