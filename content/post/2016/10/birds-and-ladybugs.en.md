A new school year started and Olivia finally became a kindergarten kid. Although she long longed for this moment, it took her a while to get used to a greater number of
children and related noise, but now she is going to the kindergarten with enthusiasm, she brings
home lots of drawings every day and she tells us what everything they did there. She also likes the
music education they have. She is in a ladybug group and her partner kid is a pre-school child
Felicia. Olivia is absolutely thrilled about her and she watched everything Felicia does.

Dominik started in the nursery in a group of birds. He is excited about singing accompanied by
movements of his hands and fingers. He likes going to the gym, walking and playing with all the
cool toys they have there. The only thing he doesn't like is when I wave him in the morning and go
away. He always has an unhappy expression on his face, but when I close the door, he is quiet and
satisfied.
