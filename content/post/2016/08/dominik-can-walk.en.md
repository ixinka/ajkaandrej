Dominik began to walk. He has already started doing the first steps about a month ago, but now he can walk longer, he tries it more often and he enjoys it more than crawling. Olivia likes to hold
his hand and to walk with him and every time I pick him up, she reminds me that I can put him down
because he is able to walk alone.

Beside walking, he likes climbing the stairs, sliding and he can ride his toddler balance bike and
he has already learned to control it. And he enjoys drawing with Olivia any time, no matter whether
on a paper or on a board or outside on the sidewalk.
