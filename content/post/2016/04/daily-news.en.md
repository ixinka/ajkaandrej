Dominik stands wherever possible, he stands up even though there is nothing to hold.

And then he tries to get back down on the floor and he doesn't like when he fells down. He likes
playing in the sand and examining our garden and I'm very pleased that he doesn't put everything he
finds in his mouth anymore. On Olivia's request, they sleep together in one room and it seems like
they both enjoy it. The best is to listen to their babbling in the morning.
