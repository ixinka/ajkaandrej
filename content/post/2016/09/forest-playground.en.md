In a small town PÃ¶ring, near to us, there is a large playground on the edge of the forest. I like it very much because it's all in a pleasant shade of trees and you can play there even when
it's hot outside or raining lightly. There is something for everyone and it's a favorite place for
birthday parties or just for a picnic. The best thing is that the children go home completely tired
every time:)
