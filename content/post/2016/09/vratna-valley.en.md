We wanted to eat some proper slovak food specialties like halušky, pirohy and šúľance, relax and relish the nature and so we made a culinary trip to Štefanova in Vrátna valley.
We made a trip to a <a href="http://en.chatanagruni.sk/" target="_blank">cottage on Grúň</a> and <a
href="http://www.chatachleb.sk/" target="_blank">under Chleb</a> and on every trip we found a
playground or sheep, so our children were more than satisfied.
