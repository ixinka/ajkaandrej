When the weather is bad, you need to find a place where it's better and so we made a trip from Stefanova, immersed in clouds, to the historical forest railway and <a
href="http://www.muzeum.sk/?obj=muzeum&amp;ix=mkd_km" target="_blank">open-air museum of Kysuce
village</a> in <a href="http://vychylovka.sk/" target="_blank">Vychylovka</a>. Our children were
enthusiastic about the train, sheep and playgrounds and we enjoyed "živánska" in a local restaurant
:) And after a pleasant walk among the wooden houses we stopped in Stara Bystrica to see <a
