Our small dark tan Dominik with blond hair and dark eyes is one year old. A week ago I would write
that he is toothless, but now I discovered two teeth on the right side (not in the front as usual), and
if another two same teeth grow on the other side, he will look like a vampire :). He likes walking
and pushing a chair and he is able to push it even when Olivia sits on it. He rides on a balance
bike and is fascinated with Olivia's bicycle bell. Every morning, when he gets up, he climbed into
the armchair, he points at the book he wants and then he reads. Beside this he tries to do
everything as Olivia does. He can stand up alone and recently he started holding someone's hand and
leads him where he wants.
