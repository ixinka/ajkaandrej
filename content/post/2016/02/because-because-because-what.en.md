That's a question that I occasionally can't answer or 

I simply don't know what Olivia tries to ask me. She asks everything; who said what, how the things
work, where is what and she also invents her own theories and enjoys them. And when she talks to
Dominik, he enthusiastically responds "ba ba ba" and then Olivia tells us what Dominik wants :)
It's been about a week since our over ten kilo Dominik has moved. He began to crawl forward, for
which we praised him with Olivia a lot and Olivia always moved his toys little bit further just to
have a chanceto encourage him even more. Beside that, he began to eat everything with great taste
and Olivia has fun by feeding him.
