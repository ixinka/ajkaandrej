This was the only trip (not counting the local trips in the forest and cycling), which we managed to
do during the summer. I planned more of them, but thanks to my incredible fatigue, I was glad that we were able to get at
least here. Kampenwand itself is a rocky hill with a cross at the very top (the largest one in the
Bavarian Alps), but the name is used to identify all the surrounding tourist area with lots of
hiking routes, cottages and chapels. We went by the cable-car to the highest possible place and
then we walked along the panorama way to the nearest hut. It's a half-hour walk providing
spectacular view of the surrounding land and the lake Chiemsee. We walked to a little chapel, we
ate a gulash soup and then I started thinking about hiking up to the hill cross. But the rocks were
shrouded in clouds and we could witness the helicopter rescue operation and so we just came back to
the cable-car station. We stopped in the panoramic restaurant to taste an apple strudel and then I
became so tired that I had to take a nap leaning on Andrej and warming up on the sun. Well, it
seems like I only extended my list of places where to go on a trip :)
