Yesterday, it started snowing. The temperature dropped to zero and we were quite pleased that we changed from summer to the winter
car tires last week. Children here are having autumn holiday next week, but they can already start
writing about winter fun. Well, it is said it should become a bit warmer and I hope so. It would be
nice to see snow again, but first in December.
