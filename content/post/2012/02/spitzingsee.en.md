Today, we went skiing to the lake <a title="Spitzingsee"
href="http://www.alpenbahnen-spitzingsee.de" target="_blank">Spitzingsee</a>. The temperature dropped to -10 and predicted sunshine showed up just before lunch, but skiing was
great. Good maintained slopes and only few people caused that we already had enough around the
lunch and we returned back home quite tired. I didn't took a lot of pictures, only one panorama
after which I seriously had to warm up my hands. But I hope to fix that this summer.
