Yesterday, we went skiing again. This time we chose <a title="Sudelfeld"
href="http://www.sudelfeld.de/" target="_blank">Sudelfeld</a> ski resort. Our colleague told us that it is a little bit small and local, but less people know about it and
therefore it usually is not so crowded on Saturday. The weather was absolutely fantastic, there
were really not so many people and we were quite surprised when we found that it is not as small as
we heard. In addition, it is a great place for skiing with children with lots of children's short
and mild slopes and help with all lifts. Skiing was great and as usual, we tasted the Kaiserschmarn
(a pancake crumbs) - very tasty and we got some strawberries as well.
