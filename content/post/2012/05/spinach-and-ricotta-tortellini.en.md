Last time I wrote  how to make a pasta dough and I dreamed about the tortellini. Than I tried to make this lovely pasta again and considering a very tasty result, I bring this
recipe to you :) Make the filling first, than prepare the dough according to the <a title="pasta
dough recipe" href="http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2012/01/19/pasta-maker/"
target="_blank">instructions here</a> (this way the dough will not becomedry while you preparing
the other things.), but use thickness 9 for the final dough sheet. Use a glass or something rounded
with a diameter ca 5cm to cut circles from the dough sheets.

**Ingredients:**
{{ 8 cherry tomatoes
1 zucchini
bunch of basil leaves
200g fresh spinach leaves
200g ricotta cheese
4 garlic cloves, sliced
1 onion, chopped
1 cup of Pecorino cheese, grated
salt, black pepper
4 tbs olive oil, extra virgin }}
**Instructions:**
Heat the 2tbs of olive oil in a large pan. Add the garlic and onion as it heats. Wash and drain the
spinach leaves and add them to the pan. Use a couple of spatulas to lift the spinach and turn it
over so it is coated with the olive oil and garlic. Cover the pan and cook for a minute, than turn
the spinach again. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste. Cook covered additional minute.
Let the spinach cool down. In a meanwhile, mix the ricotta cheese and half of Pecorino in a large
bowl. Chop the cooled spinach mixture, add it to the bowl and combine well with the cheese.

Spoon the mixture in the centre of the dough circles, fold into half, connect the ends and press
them together. Boil water in a large pot, cook tortellini 5 minutes. In a meanwhile, cut the
zucchini into semicircles and tomatoes into halves. Heat the rest of the olive oil in a sauce pan,
add zucchini and cook stirring on high heat for about 4 minutes until the edges of the zucchini are
brown. Add tomatoes, cover the pan and turn the heat off.

Combine the cooked tortellini with zucchini and tomatoes carefully in a bowl. Serve with the basil
leaves, sprinkle with the rest of Pecorino cheese.
