I already hadfelt like we travelled not alone on the plane to Mallorca, but it was just a feeling
and I convinced myself that it's rather unlikely to be truth. After our vacation, I was full of energy only about two days and then it went down rapidly. I slept
everyday 12 hours, during the weekend even more but nevertheless I felt like a ghost. Every day in
the morning, I got up terribly tired and at the work, I always received a nice careful compliment
that I look horrible and I should do something about it. In mid-July, I slowly began to be
convinced of a little baby living in my belly, but I wanted to be sure and so even though I had
told Andrej it probably hadn't worked this time, we went to the pharmacy to buy a baby test. Well,
I think the test was weird because instead of waiting 5 minutes for a result, it turned blue
earlier than I managed to use it properly. It was so blue that I could contribute with a picture to
the attached leaflet, but at least it caused that Andrej glowed like a Christmas tree, so it was
definitely worth :)

<em>**What we've already known about the little one**

<ul>
	<li>It has really an enormous energy consumption (of my energy) and every time I slept less or I
spent more energy at work, I ended up in a bed with a fever. And so I learned to relax.</li>
	<li>It's thermophilic. I just open a fridge and my belly has a strange feeling of coldness,
slightly deflates and I have to move away. The result is that I dress my belly in an extra
layer.</li>
	<li>My sense of taste is changing a lot, but in general, I prefer a Slovak cuisine, particularly
dishes that I've not eaten for years. And I can eat tomatoes and sauerkraut anytime.</li>
	<li>It likes when I caress my belly. Whatever it's doing it stops and I feel like it swims to that
place and enjoys it.</li>
	<li>It is quiet and curious. It's hard to find him/her, when we want to hear his/her heart beating.
We can hear quiet beating for a while and then it fades out. But when we push on my belly and wait
for a while it swims closer and the heart beating becomes louder until finally it snuggles down and
we can hear loud and happy beating clearly until something disturbs him/her.</li>
	<li>It likes movement. Especially around 4-5 in the morning, it regularly tests what everything can
be moved. I already have quite got used to it and I use this time to listen to italian.</li>
	<li>Originally, I was looking for some body lotion suitable for such a special belly with the
tenant, but after reading what all the chemicals they contain, I ended up with an organic walnut
oil. I think it's happy with this choice, especially when Andrej spreads the oil all over my belly
with his big warm hands.</li>
</ul>
Due to the many curious people, interested in gender of our little one, I decided to make a small
survey. So everyone can take a part and express what they think it is, or what they would wish to
us :)
