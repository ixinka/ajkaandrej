We discovered this sweet meal at <a title="Wallberg" href="{{< ref "/post/2010/08/wallberg" >}}" target="_blank">Wallberg</a>. First time, we ordered it just to try what it tastes like  (since then only on purpose :)). Then I looked for some good recipe and how to prepare it and now I use this slightly modified recipe from the LandLeben magazine.

**Ingredients:**  

* 220 g flour (plain one used for pancakes)
* 8 egg yolks
* 8 egg whites
* 400 ml milk (or in combination with whipped cream)
* 2 tbsp sugar
* pinch of salt
* butter to bake
* a handful of raisins (can be soaked in rum)
* icing sugar for decoration
* applesauce for dipping

**Instructions:**
Mix the egg yolks with sugar and salt. Add the flour, milk and combine until smooth. Whisk the egg
whites until frothy and gently stir to the dough. In the frying pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter
and pour and spread about a centimeter thick layer of dough. Sprinkle with raisins. Let it bake on
a medium temperature for about 5 minutes, until the bottom is golden brown. Then turn to the other
side (the top part can be leaking a bit). Use a spatula or a knife to cut it into small pieces just
good to eat and bake. Just before it's finished, sprinkle it all with a little amount of sugar and
bake together so the pieces are crispy. Last time I used instead of a pan a small deep tray. In
this case, pour melted butter and all the dough into it at once and bake at 200 degrees until
golden brown. Cut the baked dough into small pieces, put some of it in the frying pan, sprinkle
with sugar and bake until crispy. Serve with applesauce as a dip for the baked pieces.
