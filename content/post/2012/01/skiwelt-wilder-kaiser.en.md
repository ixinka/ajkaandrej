We spent last two Wednesdays skiing in neighbouring Tyrol in the ski resort <a title="SkiWelt Wilder
Kaiser" href="http://www.skiwelt.at" target="_blank">Wilder Kaiser</a>. Every time we parked in another town, we went to the highest possible place by a cable car and then
we skied cross over the hills everywhere where we could get by the ski lifts. The weather was
absolutely fantastic and I took some pictures as well.
