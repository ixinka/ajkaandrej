This year, we couldn't decide where to go on holiday. My usual desire for trips became unbalanced
due to the work fatigue and it was replaced by a new desire (very unusual for me) to go to sea on a
beautiful sandy beach and at most to make a trip to some of the local restaurants for culinary specialties. Andrej
couldn't believe his ears (after all those years with me, he has experienced many things but he
only dreamed quietly about such a vacation with me when we became a couple) and a sudden panic
seized him, what we're actually going to do there. We were thinking about <a title="Evergreen
island â€“ Ischia" href="http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2008/06/28/evergreen-island/"
target="_blank">Ischia</a>, last time it was really great there, but I wanted to try something new.
Sardinia must be booked in advance because of prices. And in Sicily, I couldn't choose a hotel in
combination with some cozy town. Well, finally we went to Mallorca to the town of Cala Ratjada in
the northeast of the island.

We viewed the inland of the island on the way from the airport to our hotel. Roads are very nice and
wide there. The only weird things for us were the roundabouts in the middle of the four-lane
expressway (no interchanges). Straw grass was occasionally complemented by a tree and except for
some houses it looked rather depopulated. But this was quickly changed with he upcoming coast and
we could see many hotel complexes and restaurants. Our hotel (La Pineda) was excellent, surrounded
by pine trees. It had only two little issues. Despite my efforts to choose a small hotel it was
still quite large complex and so we couldn't enjoy our breakfast and dinner in peace and quiet. The
second problem was that the pool bar was extremely slow-running.

There are three beaches in the town with crystal clear water. We used to go to the Cala Agulla the
most. It was the longest beach and we could sleep comfortably in the shade of pine trees.

We relaxed very well. I even picked up my lost energy and finally we made a trip to the lighthouse
at the very east point of the town. From the specialties, we tasted only Tapas and some salad and a
cake in the hotel. The problem was we couldn't find something typical Majorcan. The town was full
of the German boutiques and fast-food restaurants. We rarely heard Spanish and when we finally
thought we found a local restaurant (even with the Spanish name), a waitress welcomed us with a
native German accent. But we ate fish at least the whole week and it was really tasty.
