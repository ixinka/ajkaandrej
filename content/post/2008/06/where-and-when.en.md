You would like to congratulate us, breathlessly watch the whole ceremony, bite your nails nervouslly
and wait if we will say correct names or just run into the church and shout some mysterious reason
why we can't be married and you don't know where and when to come? Well, we have prepared this
article specially for you and you can find here all the necessary information.

We'll agree with love to join our lives on <span style="color: #73a025;">**16.8.2008 at 4pm in
Virgin Mary's roman-catholic church in Senica (Slovakia).**</span>
Please read carefully the map below to not get lost. We have struggled to describe all the
important places by icons (hotel - a red bed, restaurant - a knife with a fork, church - a yellow
house), but if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to send it via email
(svadba@ajka-andrej.com) and we'll be happy to answer.
