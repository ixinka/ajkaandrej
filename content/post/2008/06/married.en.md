**"We like each other, so we got married."**
To be <a title="Wedding announcement"
href="{{< ref "/post/2008/07/wedding-announcement" >}}">married</a> or not? That's the
question :) and you need to answer it for yourself but after several weeks of <a title="Videos"
href="{{< ref "/post/2008/09/videos" >}}">marriage</a> we can say that it's even better
than before. Andrej is only complaining that I drink his coffee, beer, wine or whatever and he always needs
another one, but nothing else has changed :) We belong to each other and we'll live happily ever
after.
