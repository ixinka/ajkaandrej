Funchal is the biggest town of Madeira and its centre was about six kilometers from our <a
title="Hotel Orca Praia" href="{{< ref "/post/2008/09/hotel-orca-praia" >}}" target="_blank">hotel</a>
which was walkable distance. There are many restaurants, shopping areas, museums and parks where
you can spend lovely time. The only thing is that this town is a little bit noisy now, because they are building many hotels
and block of flats everywhere. That was one of the reasons why to stay in a hotel in a quiet and
peacefull place away from the town. You should visit botanic gardens as well. You can go by cable
car to the tropical one, what is more expensive than classic public transport but it's worthy of
viewing all the town. The second botanic garden is smaller but I really loved all that parrots I
could see there.
