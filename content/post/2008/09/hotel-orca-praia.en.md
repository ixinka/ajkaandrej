After one week of living in this hotel we can recommend it :).  It's built in the rock so every room
is turned towards the ocean. The funny thing was that they counted floors from zero to minus ten.
Good advice is to not live lower than minus eight floor because these rooms are without the balcony
and you can see trees right in front of your windows instead of the ocean.

I really loved a breakfast. The restaurant was on the minus nine floor and one its wall was composed
of windows so we could see the ocean and flying seagulls and listen to the humming of the water.
It's not too far away from <a title="Funchal"

hotel has a nice private beach.
