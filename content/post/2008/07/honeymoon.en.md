We finally found the right place for our honeymoon. It is a wonderful tiny island in Atlantic Ocean,
which belongs to Portugal. The island of <a title="East Madeira"

beautiful botanic gardens, mountains and views of the ocean and many nice people with their own
traditions. We spent there  wonderful time and took  <a title="Madeira"
