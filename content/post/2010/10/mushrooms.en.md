Finally, we managed to go to gather mushrooms, what we dreamed about all the summer. We dressed
properly, put hats on our heads, equipped ourselves with baskets and knives and set off into the
forest. Besides youthful mushrooms peeping out of the ground we found also lots of old, mouldy or dried
mushrooms and we obviously came at the end of the mushroom season, but we still managed to gather a
nice amount of healthy ones and when I consider three-hour walk through the forest, we were very
satisfied. Together with Andrej we found two beautiful large mushrooms, so we were really joyful.

At home, we needed to clean and slice all the mushrooms. Those smaller and younger together with
yellow chanterelles ended up in scrambled eggs and the rest was dried. The result of our efforts
were eventually three large bottles of dried mushrooms, at which I still look with great
satisfaction.
