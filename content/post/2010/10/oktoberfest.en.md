200. anniversary of the Oktoberfest is over and people in traditional costumes are slowly but surely
disappearing from the streets and the subway, so people like us dressed only in jeans and T-shirt
don't look like tourists anymore. {{< panorama "/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/OktoberfestSprievod.jpg"  >}}
Although we haven't been in the beer tent on the Theresienwiese, we didn't miss parade at the launch
of this year's festivities. There were horse drawn carts with barrels of beer and venison, but also
agricultural machinery and many brass bands. Everyone, who was a part of this parade, moved from
the one end of the Munich centre to the area where Oktoberfest happened (about 3.5km). Well, there
were realy many people and the parade lasted three hours. We watched all the people from a balcony
at Andrej's boss appartment with a lot of other known and unknown people and we ate typical white
sausages with sweet Bavarian mustard and cheese, salad, pretzels and of course we drank beer.

park was relatively empty and ideal for a walk :)
