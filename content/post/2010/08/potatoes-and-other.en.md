Since we have lived in Munich, we eat more meat, wholemeal bread, vegetables and fruit. On Sunday,
everything except a bakery and Biergarten is closed and so on the way from the church we always
enjoy the fresh bread rolls and when the weather is nice we spend the afternoon somewhere out in
the park. Given the prevalence of organic and bio products in the supermarkets, it happens quite
often that these kinds of fruits or vegetables or eggs from free range hens wander to our basket.
But as we still have to die on something, we sometimes tear into a pizza:)

Generally, we got used to a higher food standard, and so were delighted by recent trip to Cerov√°.
Among seedbeds for potatoes and vegetables, we ate currants and pears, we didn't even miss peas and
we ended up with apricots. Then a vegetable soup from just dug carrots, parsley, kale and potatoes
is cooked and one realizes what a huge taste difference between them and a bought version, which
typically ripes somewhere in a warehouse , or directly on a shelf in the store, exists. And
although it is more convenient to go shopping, while it is not necessary to use a grub hoe or to
make your hands dirty, I still hope to have at least a mini opportunity to grow something by myself
and to show to our children, that for example such as potatoes do not grow in the net on a shelf.
