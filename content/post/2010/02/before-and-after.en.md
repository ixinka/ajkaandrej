Well, I think we settled down. We still miss some furniture like a sofa, but otherwise we can say
that our home is finally livable :). The christmas time was wonderful, we met our friends and
family again and eventually we spent some time with our little cute niece. But beside relaxing, we
also thought a lot about decorating of our new apartment. When we finally came home, we spent a week by tidying, mounting the furniture and unpacking all the
things we had. Andrej got a new toy - a great drill, so he could make all the necessary things to
be fitted.Even it was tiring, I think it was worthy. To get you an idea how it looked before and
how it looks now, see images below.
