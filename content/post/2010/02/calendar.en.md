Well, creating of this calendar is a long story and I really mean long. The main problem was I
couldn't find any way how to link all the pages together, so it would look like a proper calendar. Finally I found the way how, but that is another story and a lesson for the future. If you think
about companies, which offer a creating of the calendar and your only task is to send them
pictures, forget about it. I couldn't find the company, which would suit me. I either had problems
with ordering, paying from Europe or there was some problem with loading pictures to their server.
However, I at least managed to print all the pages and send it to my lovely parents by another
complicated way :)(I would like to thank my senders).Well, it will be better next time. As some
people wanted to see this work as well and there is only one hard copy, I decided to make it public
here :)
