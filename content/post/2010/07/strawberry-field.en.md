We somehow found out that we have a strawberry field near our house. Just cross the street with a
basket in your hand, pick all the big juicy sweet strawberries, pay to the lady in the booth and
look forward to the strawberry cake :) That was our plan last saturday morning and it was
successful.

We had about five kilos of strawberries, but we managed to eat all of them and make a dream
strawberry cake as well. There are also fields with flowers and something we haven't identified yet
:) But I'm sure we will discover it when it will grow up.
