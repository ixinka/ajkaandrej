nullSo finally, we have a new car, our Megi (renault Megane Grandtour). Currently happily relaxing in
the garage, but we've already managed to drive a little bit pressing at least half of the buttons
inside trying to figure out what they are good for :). Now, we only hope that it will serve us well
and we will experience many safety kilometres.
