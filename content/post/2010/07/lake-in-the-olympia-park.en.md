I've already written about the Olympia park, but that was in November last year and at that time
there wasn't any lake but the muddy place and some people who cleaned it. Fortunately, it's the
great place for visitors due to the high tower in the centre so we had a great opportunity to go
there with our friends and see the actual lake :) There were many people running around or cycling, lot of stands with ice-cream or some sweet cakes and of course many people sitting in the bier garden. Some people rent the boats on the mentioned
lake and enjoyable summer comfort was felt everywhere.

Another place we visited was an Olympic stadium. We somehow managed to skip it the first time, but I
suggest it is better to see it in the summer anyway. It is used only as a tourist attraction now,
which I think is shame. It's a big nice stadium with lots of seating.
