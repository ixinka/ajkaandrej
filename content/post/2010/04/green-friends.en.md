It was warm and sunshine weather yeasterday, so we went for a walk and finally finished in a huge
greenhouse. We spent there a couple of hours and bought some green friends, which joined us in our
home :)

All of them should have (according to scientists) some sort of super power to absorb ill substances
from the air in the room and make it better. I'm not sure how we could compare it with the previous
air in our apartment, but our living room looks definitely better now :)
