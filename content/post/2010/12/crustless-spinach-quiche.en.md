This is one of those recipes, which are really easy to prepare and it is also a nice opportunity for
the spinach to be spent :). I did many changes to the original recipe. However, I think there are
still loads of possibilities for improvements and adaptation to different tastes.

**Ingredients (for 24cm baking form):**
(general stuff)
{{ 1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup creme fraiche (I usually use the whole 200g package)
1 cup milk (I use finely shredded potatoes for the richer version instead)
4 eggs
butter for greasing }}
(to taste)
It can be whatever you like - chopped zucchini, tomatoes, salami, broccoli, cauliflower ... The mass
all together should fit into 1 and 1/2 cup. For this recipe, I used:

{{ cca. 200g spinach leaves (it works with frozen ones as well)
200g smoked bacon, chopped into small cubes
1 onion&gt;
4 garlic cloves
lots of parsley, chopped, the best fresh
black pepper, salt
1tbsp oil for frying
grated cheese (optional) }}

**Directions:**
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Brown the onion, garlic and
bacon. Add spinach leaves, season with pepper, salt and parsley and saute for about 5 minutes. Set
aside the frying pan and let the mass cool down a bit. Meanwhile, whisk eggs together in a bowl.
Gradually add the remaining ingredients from the general stuff and mix until smooth. Add the
mixture from the pan into the bowl. Mix well. Lightly grease the baking form with the butter. Pour
the whole mixture into the prepared form (sprinkle with the cheese if used) and place in the oven.
Bake for 10 minutes, then turn the heat down to 170 degrees and bake another half hour or until the
centre of the quiche is firm and pale golden on top. Enjoy.
