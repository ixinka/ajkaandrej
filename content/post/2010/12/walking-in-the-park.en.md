Walking in the park in winter, especially when there is snow everywhere, is absolutely fantastic.
Although only until the sunset, because then it starts freezing properly and it is better to hide
even in the subway. As I haven't been in Englischer Garten at the time of snow, we went there
during the last weekend. Originally, we wanted to go sledging on the nearby hill, but the season
was just opened and so we concluded that there would be too many people anyway.


Children sledged here as well, every hill was occupied. The best shout of all was of one child
rolling down the hill shouting "yipe", who apparently went through all the bumps. One of the
Biergarten solved the outdoor seating in the cabins of some cable car. What surprised us the most
were the surfers on the local stream. I naively believed that there are people surfing only in the
warm weather. One could say that after all they have proper wetsuits, so it actually doesn't matter
what the weather is like. But I still think that when they throw themselves into the ice water with
uncovered faces, it must be still shock for them :)
