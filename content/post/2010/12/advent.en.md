After three years, this year's advent is special for us. Finally, we don't plan Christmas as a
common holiday after long months, when we haven't seen each other. We actually live together, enjoy
snow and we're not stressed whether I'll be stuck somewhere at the airport due to bad weather.

Finally, I got rid of the school and writing of my thesis (although I'll certainly begin to think
about my defense in the next year) and I started to enjoy winter. The result is planned skiing in
January (and another skiing during the weekends after the discovery of other ski centres in our
neighborhood). The very short video shows how it looks like outside :). I also made an Advent
wreath and we started to fully enjoy the Christmas  season. There is our first Christmas tree
packed in the box awaiting in  our cellar and I'm only thinking how to decorate it :).
