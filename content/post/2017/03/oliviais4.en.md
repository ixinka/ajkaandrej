Olivia talked about her birthday since summer. She couldn't wait till she would put four candles on her birthday cake, light them  and blow them out. We celebrated together, with her friends, with the grandparents and finally in the kindergarten with cakes. Luckily, everyone has birthday only once a year :).
Olivia got <a title="Cubetto" href="https://www.primotoys.com/"> Cubetto </a> (she calls him Kubo), a small robot to learn programming and improve spatial orientation in a funny way. Dominik was excited as well and he was always waiting impatiently, while Olivia set the steps for the robot so he knew what to do, in order to push the button and watch how the robot moves.
Olivia still surprises me with her drawings and what everything she already knows.
