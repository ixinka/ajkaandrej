It has fascinated me since Olivia was born, how the nature works.  Small wounds, irritated skin, red patches when sweating, sore eyes or small rash â€¦ there is no need
to have a wound cream or drops, just use your breast milk and everything disappears quickly. I also
successfully solved Dominik's running nose only with my breast milk. Not to mention how
enthusiastically he drinks and when he is full enough he smiles at me and he gently bites me.
Dominik, with his length, is still somewhere on the curve showing the maximum length for his age,
with his weight he jumped out of the table and his doctor confirmed that I have a cream instead of
milk :) I think if he would be bottle fed I would certainly be chased for overfeeding him.
