The grilling season began and this year we decided to actively participate in it. Olivia is excited about eating outside in the fresh air.
She is also interested in everything our neighbours do. And when nothing interesting is happening,
she draws with chalk on the balcony. She likes drawing in general and she can draw nicely a round
face with eyes, mouth and nose and she is very enthusiastic about brush painting so we made a
cardboard house together.
