Domink grew by 3.5 cm in the first two weeks and he already weighs over four kilos. He begins to smile and watch what is around him. In the morning, we
manage to prepare everything and go to the nursery with Olivia quite well. We still need to
fine-tune the evening so that Dominik would sleep and I could undisturbed put Olivia into her bed.
