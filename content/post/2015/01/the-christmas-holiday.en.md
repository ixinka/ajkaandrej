Olivia started talking even more than before and we understand more and more. During the Christmas holiday, she was busy meeting loads of people,
chasing cats in the yard and when there was snow we finally rode the wooden sled. The best of all
was to shovel snow, then we couldn't get her inside. And we tried to sleep and rest as much as
possible.
