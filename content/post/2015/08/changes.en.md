I'm not sure what was a more significant change for Olivia, brother or moving to a new house, but in any case it slowly begins to influence her. She's much more sensitive than before and we're never
sure how she responds. We haven't had many opportunities to walk around the neighbourhood yet, but
we tried at least a playground in the near forest and we met one wild boar. Olivia enjoys a ponies
riding on a nearby farm. Dominik has already six and half kilos and closely watches Olivia's every
step.
