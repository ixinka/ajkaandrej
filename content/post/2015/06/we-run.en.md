Lately, the best game is to run, no matter whether we are inside or outside. 
We take a break only while waiting for a traffic light. Besides running we play soccer or dance.
Olivia likes to ride her balance bike everywhere. She is fast and lift her feet off the ground so I
run and run after her. The best afterwards is to sit on the couch at home waiting for her to
explain me what everything she cooks for me and let her bring it to me. Olivia's brother doesn't
have any problems with running even though he sometimes kicks me very uncomfortable with his feet.
Well and I need a midday nap every day to preserve my energy throughout the day.
