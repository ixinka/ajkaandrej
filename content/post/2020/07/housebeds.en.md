We came up with a new project with our kids. We drew together, calculated how much wood we need and went to buy it together. Then Andrej sawed it and cut it and the children helped to drill holes and to assemble it. And finally, house beds were created, well actually only house frames, but the joy was great. We will also sew some walls and windows for them, so that there is something to do while we are at home :)
