And the end of the school year is here. We spent a big part of it at home, but every time it was possible to go to the school, Olivia was very happy to go. At the end, children received a bunch of colorful awards and a four-page evaluation of the work during the year. And they also got homework for holidays, which Olivia was very happy about - to breakfast an ice cream, to climb a tree, to build something from the sand, to stay up until sunset and so on. Both our kids went on holidays as soon as possible. And to be able to play piano also during the holidays, we gave her a piano for travelling.
