Olivia wanted to ride a horse for some time ago, but in addition to all the activities we have, it seemed  impossible to me. So sometimes we went to ride a pony and, as I led him, I was hoping he was lazy enough to run away. Then, in the autumn, we discovered holiday courses with Icelandic ponies, which, in addition to being cute, walk so that it does not burden the spine. Olivia is fulfilling her dream, she has already been on three courses, learned a lot of theory, mastering a pony and waving the audience during a trot.
