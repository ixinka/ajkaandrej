Our lovely children got picture cookbooks for Christmas. With their help, they are able to cook everything by themselves. I only helped them to find the needed ingredients. They already tried to make mini pizzas, muffins, sponge cake, baked potatoes, salad, baked pasta and waffles. Everything was delicious! They enjoyed cooking and were very proud of themselves. Yummy!
