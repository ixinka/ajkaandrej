The Christmas holidays started a little bit earlier in a very good mood, because Olivia's quarantine ended and she could go out again (it's really great to have a garden). The children picked a wonderfull tree and they also decorated it beautifully. We "caught" carps and a pair of trouts for dinner at a local fishmonger. And a bit at the last minute, but I still managed to bake waffles. We spent Christmas building houses and tracks for balls, and we eagerly read new books. In one of them, we read how trees communicate together, and that by hugging a tree it is possible to get energy, so we immediately tried it out on the next walk through the forest. A little more positive energy would fit into the new year.
