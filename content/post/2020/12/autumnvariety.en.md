Except for one quarantine at the end and the earlier Christmas holidays, the beginning of the school year was ordinary (well, without considering wearing the face masks). Activities for children also started, except for the swimming course, so we were going swimming on our own until they closed the city swimming pool. At home we did some gardening. We also did a lot of trips on bicycles to the villages around to get to know our surroundings better. It seemed to be too cold in the forest. Children both switched their bikes to bigger ones, so we managed longer distances at a pretty good pace. At the beginning of November, Olivia enjoyed another weekend with horses after a long time and that was also the end of public activities due to Corona. And so we were creative and innovative at home. Once we even shoveled snow. We spent time on cooking and baking and we were slowly preparing ourselves for Christmas.
