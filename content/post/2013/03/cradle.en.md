We had our first visit since there have been three of us and we got a wooden cradle. It found its place in the living room next to our couch. Our midwife was fascinated with it too when
she saw it. I'm not sure how long it will serve us (when our dear child beggins to jump out from
it), but now it's great for napping throughout the day. Grandparents visited us for really very
short time, but Olivia looked happy in the grandma's hands and we felt very comfortable that we
didn't have to think about how is Olivia.
