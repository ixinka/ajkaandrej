So we bathed our little baby for the first time. After a week, her umbilical cord fell away and we took her to the first walk in a stroller. We also
somehow managed changing her diapers (an electric heater above the changing table is absolutely
fantastic thing) and we only had to handle bathing in water. I expected many reactions, but not
that she will be so satisfied. Our midwife came to help us and teach us once again some of those
useful tricks. Andrej chose the work of photographer and I took Olivia with concern. I felt that
she looked at me, startled, what I'm going to do with her, but when I plunged her into warm water
in the sink, she was completely relaxed and I could do with her what I wanted. Excellent baby :) I
hope she enjoys bathing everytime, so we could go later into the swimming pool.
