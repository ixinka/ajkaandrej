Firstly, it seemed like she would be slithering on her belly. But it somehow didn't impress her and
she began to crawl. And after a week, when I thought she would crawl faster and I'd chase her around the house, she began to stand up (she
is a bit in a hurry, isn't she?). When she is very interested in something she can get to it very
quickly, but she has more fun with searching for things that help her to stand up. So now we use
all the boxes and mattresses to build her a playground. She likes playing with her car seat or a
laundry basket and when there is nothing else she come to us and climb up clutching our knees and
clothes. And she starts looking at our stairs. She practices primarily with her toes, therefore I
crocheted her special socks without tips so she can still feel her toes on the floor but her feet
are nicely warm (btw these are the only socks that remain on her feet). When she is unable to stand
longer, she usually falls down on her bottom (luckily there is a diaper), she flexes her legs
totally straight outwards or looses her balance and then we need to catch her to avoid getting
hurt. Well yesterday, I finally managed to get waterproof trousers in her size, so we went to the
playground to try them immediately. Now she can crawl with other babies outside as well.
