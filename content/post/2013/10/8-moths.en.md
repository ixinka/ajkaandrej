Among her friends, who she plays with, she is the only one who can stay, has a lot of hair and no teeth. She is going through another growth spurt and so it's
a little bit more difficult to put her in sleep. Most recently, we play hide and seek games and she
laughs a lot and we all crawl throughout our home. Today, she was finally brave enough to crawl
under the table and chair. She likes going out. She often stands up to the balcony door, looking at
what is behind the glass and when I open the door she crawls out. She helps me by hanging laundry
on a clothesline (she takes all the clothes pegs out of the basket) and she has such a mischievous
smile when she wants to do something she knows we will not let her.
