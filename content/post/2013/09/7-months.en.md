Holidays finished and all our activities started again. Today we learned to jump/fall into the water and to swim with a swimming board. Olivia crawls nicely and moves
quickly where she wants, especially when she is interested in something (like the laundry basket or
slippers). We also started course for children. For the first hour, we took daddy with us to
conclude his parental leave. In July, Olivia was one of the last ones, who began to rolled over and
now she was the only one (except the one month older baby boy) on her knees and she crawled among
the other children and put everything what she found into her mouth. And to my great pleasure, she
occasionally sleeps through the night.
