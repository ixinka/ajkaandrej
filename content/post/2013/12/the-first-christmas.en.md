I think Olivia doesn't understand unwrapping Christmas gifts yet, but she likes their content very much. To my great joy she started to use sign language eg. the light is
turned on, she finished eating and she is going to wash her hands, hand waving bye bye, how tall
she will be and her grandma taught her to rotate her hand when she asked how she is. Successfully,
she goes on a potty several times a day and enthusiastically watches flushing a toilet. And her
second tooth grows.
