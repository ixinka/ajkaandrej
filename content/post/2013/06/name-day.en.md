We celebrated the Olivia's firstname day. On her behalf, thank you for all the congratulations. She spent the morning playing with her peers (they talked with their own language, they pulled and
sucked together one long chain and some of them already were able to roll and the other watched
them with interest :)) In the afternoon, she played at home. Andrej brought her wooden baby gym and
she was really happy about it. In addition, we gave her an oball. I discovered this in one of our
courses. Thanks to its structure, Olivia could grab it from anywhere and played with it constantly.
She rolls to the sides smoothly, now she only needs a poke to roll over.
