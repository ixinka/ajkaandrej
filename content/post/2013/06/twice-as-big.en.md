Our little one already weights 6110 grams and so she more than doubled her weight, which she had at
birth. She began to play with her feet and clap them. Previously, she already managed to turn on her side,
but that was more or less by accident. Now, she is trying it consciously and when she fails, she is
angry with herself. The result of her effort is that she rotates around her own head in a circle.
However, she is able to grasp every object around her, even if we put it out of her hand reach (we
will probably need to motivate her somehow else).

During the weekend, we took her for the first time in the forest and in the Biergarten for the roast
ribs (she successfully outslept this part of our trip). She followed with great interest all the
trees and this trip tired her enough for a long night's sleep :).
