She grows really fast. Sometimes I look at her in the morning and I feel like she grew overnight at least few inches up. And when cutting nails, I feel that while
I'm cutting them on the other hand, they grow long on the first one again. She weighs just over
5.6kg and she recently puts her both hands in front of her together putting them all into her
mouth. She started to drool pretty much, so I wonder, when she begins to lick everything around.
She smiles at us every morning turning her head in our direction. We have a new baby carrier for
her and I must say I regret a bit that I didn't find it at the very begining. Olivia sits nicely in
it, she doesn't slip and I can put her in in few seconds. Finally, she is able to stay in a
pushchair when she is awake curiously watching around.
