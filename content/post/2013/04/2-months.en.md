Our little Olivia is two months old. Actually, she is not very small anymore, she grew about ten centimeters up and weighs about 4.8kg. She smiles a lot, but she can curle her
mouth as well when she doesn't like something and she generally makes targeted grimaces trying to
imitate us. She likes looking into the mirror and the windows, I think it's because of the light.
She got used to regular walks in a stroller and when the sunlight is disturbing her by sleeping she
is able to stretch her cap under her nose. She is increasingly active, very perceptive and curious.
When she gazes at something it's better to not disturb her, otherwise you always earn an angry look
and a good dose of screaming. She loves foot massage and she can easily fall asleep by it. She
sleeps and eats a lot and she makes us happy.
