Our little baby already weights 7kg. She smiles a lot and watches all carefully. When she hears me but doesn't see me, she raises her head high and looks at where I am. Then when I
suddenly peek out from behind the door she smiles from ear to ear. We taught her to blow, so now we
can hear ppfff and fffuuu from the crib and when I look at her she is smiling at me with a
questioning look in her eyes and four fingers in the mouth. She is already able to move few
centimeters forward. She bounces from the ground with her foot, she lifts her bottom a bit and
stretches towards the toy. She cannot roll from the back to her belly yet but it's not a big deal
for her. She gets more angry when she cannot move forward.

For her keen interest in food, we started testing veggies and fruits with her. She still tries to
suck a teaspoon, but eats more and more (1-2 teaspoons) and opens her mouth widely. She didn't
refuse anything yet. We tried potatoes, carrot, broccoli and mangold. I also give her the larger
pieces (banana, apple, pear, carrot, turnip) to suck and taste it.

She likes water, so beside taking a bath we try to take her once a week in the swimming pool. She
kicks with her legs and looks at us curiously when we dive into the water. She doesn't let another
baby to take her a toy so easily, but when two months older baby pushes her away she doesn't do
anything and looks surprised. And if it happens to get around a baby foot she grabs it and sucks.
She is now longer active and awake. We slowly omit the late afternoon sleep and instead of three
times per day (roughly at 8-9, 11-13, 15-16) she sleeps only twice (roughly at 8-9 and 12-14). Her
enthusiasm for trees, flowers and everything green still persists. She likes to dive with her hands
into moss and twitch the surrounding grass and I just watch her to not eat everything.
