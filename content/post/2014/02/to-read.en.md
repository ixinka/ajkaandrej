Last year was great, but it's a pity that it has passed so quickly. Among other things, we attended two interesting courses with Olivia starting when she was about four months old.

One
of
them
(here
called
PEKiP)
was
based
on
the
idea
of
the
Czech
child
psychologist
Dr.
Jaroslav
Koch,
who
dealt
with
sensory
and
motor
stimulation
of
children
under
one
year.
The
main
idea
was
that
while
we
moms
were
talking
about
everything
related
to
our
babies
watching
them
carefully,
our
children
played
naked.
Although
I
didn't
think
that
it
makes
such
a
difference,
Olivia
could
move
much
easier
without
diaper.
There
is
a
bunch
of
books
about
PEKiP
activities,
but
I
was
interested
the
most
in
one

The completely different second course was based on the idea of <a title="Pikler education"
href="http://www.pikler-verband.org/index.php/en/" target="_blank">doctor Emmi Pikler</a>. With the
motto give me time to do it myself, moms sat around the room and watched their children playing and
dealing with different situations. I must say that it's really easy to show your child directly how
to do everything or even better not to wait and do it for him, but it is very difficult only to
observe him and believe that he knows much better how and help him only when requested and
communicate with him with respect even though he is so small and silent. Emmi Pikler work is very
similar to Maria Montessori, both liked the idea of Jean Piaget that when we immediately say child
the solution we take him the opportunity to figure it out alone. Doctor Pikler dealt just with
children to the nursery age. This course included the evenings for parents without children, where
we drunk the tea and talked about many problems and potential solutions to them. I don't have a
specific book to recommend. I read borrowed <a title="Mit Kindern wachsen"
href="http://www.arbor-verlag.de/zeitschrift/sonderheft-s%C3%A4ugling-und-kleinkind"
target="_blank">journals</a> with article about Pikler-playroom and experienced theory in practice,
but I think anything dedicated to this theory is worth reading.

We
found
useful
using
the
sign
language.
I
have
thre
books
to
this
subject
-
<a

Olivia chose from that quantity of things I showed her what she needs the most for us to understand her. She also adapted signing to her abilities or she just created her own expresions. I think it doesn't matter, because the point was to improve the communication with her, which we did.
