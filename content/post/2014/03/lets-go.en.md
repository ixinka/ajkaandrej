Olivia decided to start walking. Although she already took her first steps some days ago, yesterday she stood up without our
motivation and went. Today she went on practising and now she is able to walk longer distance. And
in last weeks, she grew up so much that I had to sort through her clothes and she is now big enough
for her little quad and so she rides it cheerfully.
