Olivia finally sits while she is playing and it's really nice to watch her. She can get angry when things go wrong and she turns her nose up at
anything she doesn't want. At her grandparents' house she learned to crawl up the stairs. She also
went four steps down upside down and then back up snarling that it didn't go quite well. At home
she already tried it sideways, so I think it's getting better. Otherwise she always smiles and
tries something new.
