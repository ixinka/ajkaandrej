Well, we really "enjoyed" last week. Olivia obviously found out that she needs other teeth after all
and now it seems that they sprout out all at once. The top right one is already out. When I ask her
to kiss me, she leans to me with an open mouth. She can put her hands behind her head and loves to
play "baram baram buc". When she finishes something or she doesn't want to do it anymore she shows
it's done with her hands. And When I'm dressing her a shirt, she dresses her hands in sleeves
herself. She already started walking with a walker through our apartment and learned to turn around
the corners as well. I can see her quite often to stand without holding with a toy in her hands.
And she loves going up the stairs wherever she has the opportunity. Quite often she laughs loudly
and we just need to join her.
