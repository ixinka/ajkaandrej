This week we were at home just the two of us. Olivia is getting used to sleeping in the nursery and I have the whole morning just for myself after
a long time. In the afternoon, we practically are still outside. We take a moment to shovel sand
into the bucket and the remaining time we're trying to climb on everything around. Olivia became a
great helper at home. She likes to be involved in everything I do - washing the dishes, stirring
while cooking, wiping her highchair after eating, hanging bib on a radiator, water the flowers,
vacuuming, sweeping, unloading things from the dishwasher. She is very perceptive and really
enjoying when I understand what she wants.
