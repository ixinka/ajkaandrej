While we were waiting for the spring, we spent a lot of time doing creative activities. Children painted and couldn't wait when the easter bunny finnaly comes. Once again, we visited an animal park in Poing. I think we will make this a tradition, because it's really amazing to see all the baby animals there. Then we spent the holidays in the field (someone takes his kids to the football match, someone to the tractor). When we came home, the weather was like in the summer except the cold mornings.
