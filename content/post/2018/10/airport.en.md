Recently, we somehow often ended up reading books about aeroplanes and airports, and so we though it might be a good idea to have a look at it closer. At the airport near to us, there is a park for visitors, so on one nice Saturday morning we set off for a trip. We were welcomed by children playgrounds, a pair of old planes, where we could go inside and a sightseeing hill which the departing and landing aeroplanes could be seen from. Children enjoyed the trip. From the top of the hill we could also observe what everything was happening at the airport (luggage cars, fuel trucks and stair cars) and we agreed that we have to plan a trip by plane.
