After a long time, we went on a trip to a nearby park. The kids were thrilled to finally make the trip avoiding sitting at home due to Corona. The weather forecast was terrible with rain, but that didn't spoil our mood. Equipped with raincoats, at the end we had wonderful weather. It rained for a moment and then at the end heavily as we were running to our car, but everyone was satisfied and pleasantly tired. The children fed deer, watched the beavers and all possible birds. Dominik was the most excited about the raccoon and the bears. We also managed to see the fox, lynx and wolves. The children climbed on the climbing frames in the playground and played in the water park. We spent lunch picnicking in the sun. It was a pleasant feeling to be on a trip again.
