Beautiful weather, not too hot. We were thinking about some short trip before lunch. Everyone agreed to go to the ruins of Korl√°tko. We somehow packed our backpacks longer than the trip itself. To get there, we set off on the way to Rozbehy, from which we turned onto a forest path and in a while we were already climbing ruins. Quite a few parts were repaired and new organic toilets appeared. We climbed as high as we could, admiring the view. On the way back, we went through the forest to the opposite side, towards the monastery on Cerova.
