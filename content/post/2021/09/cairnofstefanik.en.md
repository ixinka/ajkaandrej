At the last moment and out of the summer season, we went on another trip, to the cairn of Štefánik. The weather was wonderful. We only missed the train that regularly goes up to the cairn from Brezová pod Bradlom during the season but we promised our children to come here sometimes again. The children were captivated by the size of the cairn and the beautiful view from above. Finally, after a few steps down the forest, we came to the Bradlo cottage, where we sat down for a coffee / Kofola with a cake.
