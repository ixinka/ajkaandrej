Olivia wanted warm and sunny weather for her birthday because she wanted to celebrate in the garden. This year, her wish miraculously came true. Spring came somehow earlier and we suddenly had 17 degrees for a week. We uncovered the trampoline, picked up scooters and inline skates, and we went to watch the birds. The birthday cake was a chocolate one in the shape of a heart and with butterflies exactly as Olivia wished. Olivia currently enjoys doing experiments and observations. Best when something can be mixed and it changes color or foams. Alternatively, she and her friend collect stones and watch them glitter. She still loves school and prefers to go to it rather than doing homework because there are so many other things at home that can be done.
