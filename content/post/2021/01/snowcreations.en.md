Our front yard is covered with snow and our children plays there everyday. First, they built a snowman. Then they enthusiastically shoveled snow into the garden so they could build a house. We helped with shoveling a little bit, but they built it by themselves. Breaking the ice also seems to be a fun activity. And last week we spent several afternoons sledding on the local hills.
