Recently, we spent some time searching for a new apartment and beside this activity we discovered
various places where we haven't previously been. We were fascinated by one such a district town at very first visit and so we went there during one
weekend again to get to know it a little bit more. We already get used to the plane everywhere in
Munich (I don't count those few artificial hills there) and we were very pleasantly surprised by
the hilly terrain of the town. There are few lakes in the town. It is surrounded by forest and has
a viewing tower, from which you can see far away, even an hour distant Alps. In a beautiful warm
weather, the town was empty â€¦ all bathed in the lake.
