This recipe I have to spread further because it's amazing. I got it from my supervisor's wife in England. She made them for me and Andrej when we visited them
during my graduation. I think we both felt in love with these great muffins, so here is the recipe:

**Ingredients (for 12 muffins):**
{{ 2 and half small ripe bananas or 2 bigger ones
125ml sunflower oil
2 eggs
100g brown sugar
225g plain flour
3 tbsp cocoa powder
1 tsp baking powder }}
**Instructions:**
Preheat the oven to 200 C (150 C for fan oven) or gas mark 6. Lightly butter a 12-hole muffin tin or
just use 12 paper muffin cases. Stir flour, baking powder and cocoa powder into a bowl. In another
bowl, blend bananas to purée, stir in the oil, stir in the eggs and finally sugar. Now gently
combine everything from these two bowls without overworking (it’s better when it’s lumpy than
smooth). Spoon the mixture into the prepared muffin tin. Bake for 20 minutes until well risen.
