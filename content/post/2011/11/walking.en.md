I love autumn from several reasons. It's not so cold yet, but also not so hot anymore and so you can wrap yourself in a warm blanket and
relish a cup of tea. The weather outside is just amazing and stable and the sky can be unbelievably
blue. And those colours ... as we moved we travel about ten minutesto work through a forest and
that is so wonderful look that fits well immediately after waking, but also to relax after work.
And so we walk somewhere every moment we have. Last time we discovered another romantic path that
connects two local lakes about 15-20 minutes from our home.
