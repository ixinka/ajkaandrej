Behind the neighbour house is a narrow path that leads up to the hill. It takes around three minutes to get on the top where beautiful four huge trees grow. It's charming
view from here and with good visibility the Alps can be seen. It's a great place where to go when
you want so see a piece of nature and you're to tired or just lazy to go anywhere further. Last
time, we discovered a children playground there with amazing slide and swing (sometimes I wish I
were smaller).
