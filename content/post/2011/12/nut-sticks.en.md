**Ingredients:**  

* pastry (ready to use sheet can be bought)
* 150g ground walnuts or almonds
* 75g sugar
* 1 egg
* Amaretto (almond liquor)

**Instructions:**  
Preheat the oven to 200 C or gas mark 6. Prepare the baking paper (a rectangle that fits your baking
tray). Whisk the egg white until frothy. Combine whipped egg white, nuts and sugar in a bowl. Add
just as much liquor to the mixture in the bowl to create spreadable mass. Spoon the mixture on the
half of prepared pastry sheet. Fold the empty part of the pastry over upon the half covered with
the mixture. Cut the filled pastry into 1.5cm wide stripes. Slowly rotate each stripe several times
and put on the baking tray. Spread twisted stripes with yolk. Bake for about half hour or until
gold brown.
