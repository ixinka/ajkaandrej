We went sledding during our Christmas holiday to relax and spend our time wisely :) <a title="sledding last year" href="http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/12/20/sledding/"
target="_blank">Here are some pictures</a> from the last year. This time, we set off earlier and so
we basically had the whole track for ourselves. I tried to make some videos during the sledding (
on steeper sections it's a bit shaky because I had to brake too). The experience was again
absolutely terrific. In between, we refreshed ourselves in the panorama restaurant on the hill,
warmed up on the sun and I took a panorama from that beautiful view around. On the map below is the
sledding track, there was no signal on that little part, which is missing. Well, we went the
fastest 30 km/h.
