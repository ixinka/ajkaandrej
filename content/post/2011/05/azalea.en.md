With our last visitors, a new resident of our living room arrived. It's a small tree or rather a bush called Azalea. I read that it's the popular plant in gardens
because it likes shady places, it's able to survive down to -29 degrees and above all it makes all
the dark corners beautiful. And when it blossomed, we understood. This plant is really charming.
