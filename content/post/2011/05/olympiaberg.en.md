We were already several times in the <a title="Lake in the Olympia park"
href="http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/07/05/lake-in-the-olympia-park/">Olympia park</a>, but we
somehow never got to the highest hill there. To walk on its top is not really difficult, but either the weather didn't work out for us, or we
were already tired from walking through the town so we ended up just resting near the lake below.
There is a nice paved walkway leading up to the top of the hill that is great view point as well.
We only realised when we walked there how big the whole <a title="Where to go with visitors"
href="http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2009/11/25/where-to-go-with-visitors/">park</a> is. Further lawns
and walkways revealed in front of us that are not seen from the lake otherwise. This hill, like
lots of others in Munich, was built artificially. This one grew up from a pile of rubble and ruins
left over from houses in Munich after a bombing in the Second World War. There is a beautiful view
over the park and the distant <a title="Munich"
href="http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2009/11/24/munich/">city centre</a> from the top. After all, judge
for yourself :)
