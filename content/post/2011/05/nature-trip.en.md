Since urban tourism is quite difficult, and as we don't want to destroy our visitors (we would like
them to come again), we have always at hand some trip to nature. Neither last Saturday it was different and we went to our quite favourite place, on the hill <a
title="Wallberg" href="http://www.ajka-andrej.com/2010/08/24/wallberg/">Wallberg</a>. Up and down
we drove a cable-car, but then we hiked to the top of the peak (about half an hour). The chapel,
which was reconstructed is already nice and finished. As usual, there were plenty of people who
similarly like we went for a walk. The cows have not grazed there yet (but we could see loads of
them on the meadows along the way from Munich), but many people doing paragliding fluttered in the
air already.

Trip was great, the view even better and after a difficult hiking we anchored in a restaurant to
gather strength. Guys ate peasant dish (sausage, bacon, sauerkraut and liver dumpling) and we tried
Kaiserschmarrn ("Kaiser", meaning "Emperor" and "Schmarrn" are "crumbs"), which are caramelised
pancake pieces with raisins and apple sauce. i need to look for the recipe, because it was really
good.
