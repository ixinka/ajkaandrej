Last weekend, we went on a trip to the lake Walchensee. It's about an hour from our home by car in a
beautiful environment surrounded by the mountains.{{< panorama "/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Walchensee-e1303547248198.jpg"  >}}

This time we didn't go alone, but we took our visitors as well. The weather was amazing and was also
pleasantly warm although, it wasn't warm enough to melt all the snow on the hills above. Near the
lake we took a cable-car and we travelled four minutes about 800 meters higher. Then we just
received a beautiful view of the surrounding nature.

Through a small snow field we got to the chapel and then we followed a nice wide path towards a near
cottage. Snow has already been melted, but it created the slippery wet slurry and so we didn't walk
anywhere else. Instead, we sat down on a sunny terrace for a soup, beer, coffee etc. Find all the
