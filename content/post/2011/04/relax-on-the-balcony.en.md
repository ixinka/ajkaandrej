We were talking about buying something on the balcony last summer, especially when I moved a chair
from a living room to the balcony and back several times. Something that would be used for sitting there in the morning to enjoy breakfast in the air and in
the evening to drink wine in the shade. But we somehow had to address to many things and no time
left to develop this idea further. Until now, when spring has arrived ( although sometimes I feel
like it is summer already), we came back to it and the result is (as we later found out) position
chairs and a table and so I can write articles and listen to the birds warble with a view to a lot
of trees :) I managed to fold the chair accidentally, when I tried to move it and I grabbed it in a
wrong way. It started folding itself (you cannot imagine our joy, that we can store it easily :)).
