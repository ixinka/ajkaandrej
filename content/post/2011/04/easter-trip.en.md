Last Friday we went to Easter trip. We had a beautiful warm weather, around 25 degrees and I saw a
newspaper tip for a nice trip to a waterfall. I thought that in this lovely April weather
everything is melting and so there could be a lot of water. After a small survey, I found two other even bigger waterfalls near the original one. From parking
places it was up to 20 minutes walk to each one and so we decided to see all of them. The first
part of our trip began in the village Bayrischzell. We found easily the path to the waterfall and
we also eyed the next trip to the Wendelstein mountain above the waterfall about three more hours
of hiking. These waterfalls are relatively small and I felt like there was not enough water, but we
didn't give up and walk a bit further toward the beautiful green lake. Well, it was at least
described in this way by the guide, but we would obviously need to return there to see it. The only
thing we saw was a little splash in the arid country. But the environment there is really charming.

By car, we moved about 15km further to the hotel Feuriger Tatzelwurm with the hope that next
waterfalls will be better. They were clearly more beautiful. But the density of the tourists there
also rose. Our third and final goal was Arzbach waterfall on the road between the two previous. On
the way from Tatzelwurm, we parked in a large parking place on the right side and walked on a wide
sidewalk on the opposite side of the road. We said hallo to a policewoman behind the bush, who was
waiting there for motorbikers who broke the rules. Waterfall is not far away, I would say that the
description 15 minutes is quite accurate when you know where to go. When the path starts to climb
up, you need to let it be and turn left towards the cottages, which are there. Waterfall is waiting
for you behind the trees. :) We didn't know it and we climbed up the hill. But when we saw nothing
and even google couldn't tell where is the falling water, we went down cross the hill. With some
random intuition we turned toward the cottages and we found the waterfall :)
