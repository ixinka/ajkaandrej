When one is desperate, they make weird decisions. Thanks to that I somehow came to this recipe. Suddenly,
we
had
a
lot
of
zucchini
and
after
cooking
zucchini
sauce,
pancakes
and
potatoes
with
zucchini
I
had
no
idea
what
to
do
with
the
rest
of
it.
I
slightly
modified

**Ingredients (for four persons):**
{{ 1/2 box Barilla Maccheroni pasta
4 PL Extra Virgin olive oil
3 cloves chopped garlic
1/2 large zucchini (sliced with peeler)
3 big tomatoes chopped to cubes
salt, ground black pepper to taste
full hand of chopped fresh basil leaves
grated cheese on top }}
**Instructions:**
Cook pasta according to instructions on the box (you cannot really overcook this pasta, it became
our favourite in Italy few years ago and since then we've used only this one). In a large deep pan
saut√© oil with the garlic over medium heat. When the garlic is nice yellow add zucchini and roast
five minutes. Finally, add tomatoes, taste with salt and pepper. Drain pasta and toss with the
sauce. Turn off the heat, mix with basil and let stand for a while to allow pasta to absorb a
tomato juice. Sprinkle ready pasta on a plate with the cheese.
