This is another option (not counting the Tyrolean Alps around the corner) to go skiing when you are
in <a title="Holiday in Grainau" href="{{< ref "/post/2011/01/holiday-in-grainau" >}}"
target="_blank">Grainau</a>. And not only that. Cable cars operate here also in the summer and
there is a wide variety of hiking trails offered by the hills.

One of the black slopes was closed due to the preparation for the World Championships (5a on <a
title="slope plan for Garmisch-Classic"
href="https://www.skigebiete-test.de/skigebiet/garmisch-partenkirchen-classic-gebiet_pistenplan.html"
target="_blank">the slope plan)</a>, but we didn't miss it at all. For me, it was enough to see the
steep slope from the lift and my knees hurt :). On this ski area I liked the variety of slopes and
the possibility of different combination. We also found lots of great ski lifts for children and
many groups led by the ski instructors. The way to the lifts from Grainau took us only 10 minutes
by the cogwheel train and from the platform it was only a few steps to skiing.

Compared with <a title="Zugspitzplatt" href="{{< ref "/post/2011/01/zugspitzplatt" >}}"
target="_blank">Zugspitzplatt</a> I could see a little disadvantage. The slopes are lying lower and
if the weather is not perfect, but with fog or low clouds, the visibility on the lower skiing
slopes can be very bad. In such a case, you should have someone with you ( I had Andrej), who
believes that there is always the sun above the clouds and he takes you up through all the mist to
the very top where you can ski in the beautiful wheather or enjoy having a good lunch with a pie
and enchanting view of the surroundings.
