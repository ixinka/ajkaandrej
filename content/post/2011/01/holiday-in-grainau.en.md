This time we traveled only about an hour and a quarter by car from our home to the village Grainau.
We wanted to ski and get to know our surroundings better. We stayed in a very nice and cozy house
with a great breakfast (<a title="Gasthaus Geigener in Grainau" href="http://www.geigerer.de/"

the two days and my darling named our vacation week assembly.

One snowy day, we made a train trip to the nearby Tyrol village Lermoos and then we went back to
Garmisch Partenkirchen, where we found a great Italian restaurant for lunch and we saw the ski
springboard and slopes for the upcoming World Championships. Although the competitions start there
on the seventh of February, it was busy everywhere and there were dedans growing up around the
competitive slopes.

During the second break day, we walked to the lake Eibsee (roughly an hour uphill from Grainau). If
you are looking on the pictures below trying to find the blue area its vain effort. The lake looked
just like a huge snowy field of round shape. This time it was completely empty there, so we turned
back and spent the rest of the day in the swimming pool in Grainau.
