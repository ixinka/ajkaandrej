This year I made several New Year's resolutions (I will sometimes write about them). One of them is
to ski this winter properly. Before Christmas, we decided to visit our friends in Switzerland and we were going to look at
several ski resorts near Zurich. But this plan failed, because during our planned weekend heat wave
arrived from Spain and at 1100 m it was suddenly 7 degrees. Finally, we opted for the more distant,
but higher placed resort Laax, where we were skiing at around 2500 m at a pleasant temperature just
below zero. You can find <a title="Laax"

In
the
Alps,
we
skied
the
first
time,
so
I
cannot
compare
it,
but
I
definitely
can
recommend
it.
We
started
skiing
when
the
lifts
were
opened
until
their
closure
(around
four
o'clock)
and
we
used
the
same
slopes
only
twice.
One
slope
was
really
long,
it
took
us
maybe
half
hour
to
get
down,
but
it
was
worthy
(number
10
on
the
right

People were scattered over the hills so much that sometimes we had wide slope only for ourselves. Well, apart from the slopes, the view of snowy hills and surrounding countryside was simply breathtaking.
