At Christmas, we were riding bicycles and there was no snow at all. I secretly hoped that it would snow at some point during the holiday so we could go sledging but it was raining instead. On the Three Kings day, we suddenly had 50cm of snow. We were busy shoveling snow in order to get into the garage and children were looking forward to riding sledge all the way to the kindergarden. I had soreness from snow shoveling, snow shovels were sold out everywhere, but our children were excited. We built a snowman, igloo and small hill for sledging and we go skiing every weekend. Although it has melted partially, we still have few feets high piles of snow around the house and we have to climb up one of them to get into the garden. Tomorrow, it's supposed to snow all day.
