Carnival time is successfully behind us. This year, Dominik enjoyed it properly as well. He enthusiastically said he wanted to be a dinosaur. It took Olivia a while to decide, but finally she ended up with a rainbow unicorn. In a kindergarden, they had a full day of games and competitions. Dominik watched everything with opened mouth and Olivia was excited that she could guide him. The next day, they went to the kindergarden traditionally in pyjamas.
