Last Sunday was very relaxing. Olivia spent three hours at a creative workshop in the morning and when she was back, Dominik fell asleep and slept till dinner time. The theme of the workshop was "I am really tall". Each child created herself from the paper in the life size. And then they together described each created character in three words. For Olivia's character they chose: lively, funny and happy.
